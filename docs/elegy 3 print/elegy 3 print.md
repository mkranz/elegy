CHAPTER I: 
INTRODUCTION

## Welcome

Elegy is a solo role playing game about being a vampire and surviving the big city nights while you hide your nature from mortals and prey on them to satiate your relentless hunger. You will hunt for blood to keep your vicious fury at bay, play your role in maintaining the secrecy of the vampire society, gamble what's left of your humanity and fight the deadly creatures that stand in your way. To play it, you create your vampire, make some decisions about the world you inhabit, and set the story in motion. When you encounter something dangerous or uncertain, your choices and the dice determine the outcome. Unlike other traditional role playing games, no GM is necessary. You portray a lone character in a dangerous world. A session can be as long as you like, from a few minutes to a few hours.

### What You'Ll Need

 Two ten-sided dice (d10). 

 A character sheet.

 Counters for marking status tracks on your character sheet (paper clips, beads, coins, etc.)

## Fiction & Rules

Elegy uses various mechanics, such as rolling dice and managing the stats and resources on your character sheet, but is also heavily reliant on the fiction, which is the imagined characters, situations, and places within your game. You will play from the perspective of your character and interpret actions and events in a way that is consistent with the dramatic, fictional reality you have forged for your story and your world.

## Elegies

An elegy is a type of song that expresses sorrow, lamentation, or mourning for the death of individuals, groups of people, or even abstract concepts. In vampire society, it can also mean a special demonstration of profound respect. To sing an elegy means to promise to accomplish something in dedication to a person or ideal. The act is a reverence to the eternal grief born from the certain demise of every soul that leaves a vampire behind; a vow vampires make each other, or themselves, over their own mourning. The biggest ordeal a vampire faces might be not the insatiable hunger, the deadly sunlight, or blending in among mortals, but the eternal grief she feels for her life, now lost forever. A whole world of relationships, plans, and dreams was killed, and its place seized by the obligation to the Façade and the nature of a monster. To vampires, death is truer than life, and grief is eternal, and that's why they swear on theirs.

## Your Vampire

### A Creature Of The Night

Most people live out their lives oblivious to the unnatural powers that surround them after dark, but you are different. You were turned into a vampire and thrown into a life of secrets, danger, shadows, and blood deep inside the heart of your city. Before you jump into the mechanics of your character, consider her motivations, interests, skills, personality, and weaknesses. It's fine to start with one or two ideas about your background and goals. You can flesh out your character as you play. 

### Your Sheet

You use your character sheet to track your stats, abilities, overall condition, and progress in your quests and bonds. However, your character is more than these mechanical bits. 

You are the protagonist in a rich story. You have hopes and fears, virtues and failings. Not only that, but you have a history. You are, or were, part of a community. This is the fiction of your character. Consider a few of these details as you create your character, but don't sweat it. You'll evolve it through play. At the start of your game, put your character on stage to see what happens. Fill in the blanks—for your character and your world—as you go.

### Be Awesome

Your character is highly competent. You're intelligent, apt, and driven. You can count on yourself to survive the night. When you sing an elegy, you mean it. You are not without your limitations. You'll face hardship. You'll make bad decisions. You will fail. Overcoming those failures, pushing on, is what makes you the cool predator you are.

### Be Who You Want

You can envision your character however you like, unbound by geography, lineage, sexual orientation, and gender. Your character can be inspired directly by a real-world or historical culture, or you might weave a blend of cultural influences into your concept.

6 CHAPTER II: 
YOUR 
CHARACTER

## Name

You have a name. Perhaps vampire historians will treat it with high esteem someday.

## Stats

There are five stats. Each is given a value from 5 to 7. When you roll dice, you usually compare them to one stat - the situation will tell you which one, or give you a choice. To start, arrange these bonuses across your five stats in any order: 7, 6, 6, 5, 5.

 **Force:** Physical strength, endurance, and aggressiveness.

 **Dexterity:** Quickness, agility and coordination.

 **Glamour:** Charisma, influence and charm.

 **Intellect:** Expertise, knowledge and observation.

 **Heart:** Empathy and willpower.

## Assets

Assets represent your abilities, background, skills, traits, and resources. When you create your character, you pick three assets. Assets may grant three different types of advantages:
 A bonus to a stat on action rolls Special abilities and fictional opportunities Using one stat in place of another on a roll

### Acquiring Assets

As you form bonds and conclude quests, you gain experience. For a few experience points, you can purchase a new asset or buy a new ability on an asset you already own. Always consider the narrative justification when you add an asset to your character. What have you done to gain these abilities? How have your goals changed to support this new focus? Make your selection meaningful in the context of your story. Power assets are assets are vampiric abilities that are developed by vampires while they sleep. Nature assets can only be chosen during character creation. Ritual assets are sorcery rites that can only be learned from very powerful vampires.

Assets cost 3 xp to buy and 2 xp to upgrade. When you upgrade an existing asset, do it in whatever order you like; you can buy the third ability before the second one, for example. Just notice your setting affects which assets are available in your game (see Truths). For example, you cannot choose a *ritual* asset if your game doesn't feature vampiric magic.

### Narrative Requirements

Narrative circumstances may force you into situations where you can't leverage a key asset, making your adventure more challenging and dramatic. Before you act using an asset, take a moment to ensure you are properly positioned and equipped to use those abilities.

### Equipment

In Elegy, you won't worry too much about equipment. You are dressed and equipped appropriately to your vision for your character. Make note of any important possessions or items you start with. These are things that might impact the narrative, or provide texture to your character's background. They don't offer mechanical bonuses unless they are represented by an asset; for example, when you possess a blade and the Cutthroat asset.

### Hypnosis

8 *Power, glamour.* When you meet a victim in the eyes, you may give it a simple command that will be obeyed instantly ("leave", "follow", "grab") unless it's harmful or impossible ("die", "fly"). The victim goes into a trance until right after the action, and won't recall the incident.

Q
 Your command can be complex 
("take this car and drive to this address at this time this day of the month") and have an activation trigger ("...when you hear the word Genesis").

Q
 You may give a suggestion that reshapes the memories of the victims ("You couldn't be in the crime scene because last Saturday morning at 8am you went to the grocery store to buy milk and eggs to bake a cake"). The more detailed the suggestion is, the more effective.

### Illusion

8 *Power, glamour.* For one scene, you can conjure a static illusion that has no actual solid presence and confuses one sense (a stench, a sound, a tattoo, etc.).

 Your illusions may appeal to all senses (you can make a cup of hot water feel like a glass of cool champagne).

Q
 You can create illusions with motion (person, running water, living being, fire).

### Lair

Q
 Your lair is very presentable.

When you search for an useful object or tool inside it, add +1 and take +1 focus on a hit.

### Lore Keeper

8 When you make a Conclusion Roll to finish a quest to recover valuable knowledge or an extraordinary relic, take +2 focus. You may re-roll any dice.

Q
 When you conduct extended research or study, re-roll any dice. On a match, you piece together an extraordinary or harrowing new theory; envision the nature of this revelation and take +1 forward if you act on it.

Q
 When you recall esoteric knowledge to your advantage, add +1. On a hit, envision the obscure but helpful fact, theory, or technique you put to use, and take +1 focus.

### Lunacy

8 *Power, glamour.* You are able to heighten or dull someone's current emotions (turn mild irritation into violent rage, or obsession into disinterest).

Q
 You can disturb someone's senses with flashes of content of their unconscious that will make them lose touch with reality for one minute.

Q
 You can make your victim mistake theirs or others' identity. For example, you can make someone think they're Napoleon, or think her wife is secretly an alien in disguise. This effect lasts for one scene.

### Magnetism

8 *Power, glamour.* When you impress or attract someone, you may sacrifice blood (1-5) to gain an equal amount of bonus on your roll. The blood you spend to activate this power counts to the bonus.

Q
 When you do it, you may lose 1 more blood to re-roll any dice.

Q
 Take +2 focus on a hit.

### Mannequin

8 You have a reliable source of blood in a mortal fascinated by you. They swore to keep your secret and be readily available whenever you are hungry. If they die and you want another mannequin, you have to pick this asset again from the start, but you may buy it for 1 xp.

Q
 Your mannequin trusts you way more than they should. When you gather info about the mortal world by speaking to your mannequin, you may re-roll any dice.

Q
 Having a steady source of blood brings you peace of mind. When you feed from your mannequin, take +1 spirit on a hit, and +2 spirit on a match.

### Marked

8 You are hunted by a power or authority. When you score a weak hit, you may improve the result to a strong hit. If you do, fill one segment of a four-segment progress track to represent hunters closing in. When the track is filled, a notable foe or force has tracked you down. If you overcome them or escape, reset the track and gain 1xp.

Q
 When you act by hiding, concealing your identity, or fleeing from a pursuer, add +1 and take +1 focus on a hit.

Q
 When you finish a quest by clearing your name or defeating the power or authority who marked you as a fugitive, gain this ability at no cost. You may then exchange this asset for another with the same number of marked abilities.

### Mutation

8 *Power, force.* You can merge with the earth below you for one scene. You can still feed if blood falls into the ground where you are. You can also climb walls without difficulty.

Q
 In this scene, you can turn into an animal (a bat, a wolf, a crow, a snake, etc.) for as long, and as many times, as you want.

Q
 For one scene, you are able to turn your skin into a scaly hide that grants you +1 in rolls to defend against damage.

### Path Of The Demon

8 *Ritual.* When you mix your blood with dirt and allow it to sit for a few hours, you create a poison lethal to mortals. Those who consume it will die in their sleep, peacefully, seemingly from natural causes.

Q
 When you pour a few drops of your blood into a vial of water and utter magical words, you transform the liquid into a drug capable of incapacitating a vampire for an entire night. The drug can be injected or ingested.

Q
 You can extract the soul of a victim from her body and transfer it permanently into one of her possessions, transforming it into a haunted and cursed object. When you unite her fresh corpse with a cherished possession of hers and sing magic words around it, the effect is activated. The object will interfere negatively on any action performed in its vicinity, except for you.

### Path Of The Eye

8 *Ritual.* When you place crossed bones and skulls at every entrance of a room (including windows and other openings) and seal them with a glyph drawn in your own blood, you ensure that every question asked within the room receives a truthful and immediate answer.

Q
 When you draw a circle in blood and walk around it, you are able to witness events from up to five years ago in that area.

Q
 When you mix a drop of your blood in a small pool of other and utter magic words while holding the possession of a target, you are able to hear and see the surroundings of the observed through the water until you leave.

### Path Of The Guardian

Ritual. When you draw a circle in blood and chant magic words, the area will magically repel… 8 …mortals and animals.

Q
 …supernatural living creatures.

Q
 …vampires and the undead.

If you possess more than one point of this asset, you can choose to repel only certain types of creatures. For instance, even with points 1 and 2, you can opt to repel only supernatural living creatures if desired.

### Path Of The Pursuer

8 *Ritual.* When you let blood flow from the palms of your hands, you can fashion a whip. When employed in combat, treat it as a heavy impact weapon (refer to Harm on page 40).

Q
 When you touch the center of your chest with red-hot metal, it renders your heart impervious to a stake for one night. Endure 2 harm.

Q
 When you submerge a pebble in blood and recite magical words, you transform the stone into a tracking device that always reveals in which direction it is. The effect persists until the pebble is destroyed.

Q
 When you awaken the powers of your blood to appear human while reflecting on a potent memory of your mortal past, you extend the effects to 24 hours instead of just one scene.

### Path Of The Spider

8 *Ritual.* When you wash your face in blood and speak the name of a victim, she will experience intense hunger. A vampire will be induced to starvation, and will act out of instinct, impulse and hunger.

Q
 When you burn a piece of paper marked with your bloody hand print and say the name of a vampire within a one-kilometer radius, the victim will lose the reanimating power of blood and turn into a corpse for a whole night.

Q
 This ceremony is only potent against living entities. By burning a strand of hair, a nail clipping, or any other refuse from the subject's body, and uttering mystical incantations, a curse is placed that can be activated at will. Upon activation, the victim's throat splits, and their bowels forcefully expel from their body, leading to almost certain death, even with immediate medical intervention.

### Path Of The Tongue

8 *Ritual.* When you inscribe a message in blood on a piece of paper and utter the recipient's name, the message manifests before her. It may appear on any solid surface within their sight (a desk, a mirror, another piece of paper) and vanishes upon being read.

Q
 When you meditate silently for 30 minutes while repeating the name of someone with whom you share a blood link (or your progenitor) you can communicate telepathically with her for one scene.

Q
 When you set fire to the tongue of a victim, you gain the ability to comprehend all languages she knows. This effect is permanent.

### Picky Taste

8 *Nature.* You always crave for the same specific type of blood (A-, blondes, doctors, leninists, etc.). Whenever you feed from this type, always restore full blood. Whenever you feed from other mortals, always gain -1 blood.

Q

When you roll to look for a mortal of your type to feed from, reroll any dice.

### Reanimation

8 *Power, intellect.* For one scene, you are able to reanimate a dead body and make it perform a simple function (dig a hole, lift heavy objects, walk there).

Q
 You can command the corpse to attack someone or something. When you fight alongside it, deal +1 harm and gain +1 focus on a hit.

Q
 You can make the corpse talk and behave as a very weird human being for one scene.

 Add +1 and take +1 focus on a hit Gain +1 health on a hit (+3 in total)
Q
 You have enough patience and stamina to take care of whatever wound you suffer, as long as you have at least a few hours and a comfortable place. When you burn focus to heal yourself, you don't need to reset it.

Q
 You have a high recovery rate. 

When you feed, you may exchange your gained points of blood for health.

### Seer

8 *Nature.* Once per day, you may envision experiencing a prophetic dream (ask the oracle for details). If you record the answer, and later face a situation which gives truth to the vision, take an automatic strong hit (one time only) when making acting on your foresight. Then, clear the prophecy. Only one prophecy can be active at a time.

Q
 When you focus or meditate to gain insight about a place, being, or situation, add +1 and take +1 focus on a hit.

### Shadow Touch

8 *Power, dexterity.* You can reshape, stretch or overlap shadows, or even separate them from their casting bodies. Your manipulation grants them a mystical density that can smother mortals.

Q
 You can create a cloud of pitchblack darkness that obscures all light and sound. The cloud is just large enough for you to hide in it.

Q
 The shadows are able to grab and restrain foes.

### Sixth Sense

8 *Power, intellect.* You can sense the intentions of people around you. When you are next to other individuals, you can awaken your powers to ask two of the following questions to the oracle. Then, add +1 and take +1 focus the next move related to the answer.

 Who's the weakest person in here?

 Who's most likely to harm me? Who's most likely to give me what I want?

Q
 You can read people's thoughts and memories. Once per night, you may psychically inspect the mind of someone next to you as if it were a book.

Q
 When you hold an object in your hands, you are able to pick up psychic impressions from it and learn who held it last and when it was last held.

### Stalker

8 When you attempt to follow someone in a crowd without being noticed, add +1 and take +1 focus on a hit.

Q
 You can mystically encrypt or decrypt a device's controls, making it inaccessible for everyone else. This also works on media (CD, flash drive).

Q
 Using only words, you can manipulate an electronic device remotely. The device will obey you even if you don't understand how it works. Of course, it won't do something it can't (a 3d printer will "print a stake", but will not "make coffee").

### Terror

8 *Power, force.* You are able to exude a deeply unsettling aura that disturbs those who make eye contact with you. When you make a roll to intimidate someone, you may release this aura and reroll any dice.

Q
 Your aura twists the victim's mind and cause frightening hallucinations. Take +2 focus on a hit.

Q
 You can project this aura to anything, not only yourself.

### Veil

8 *Power, dexterity.* You can become invisible for one scene. While invisible, when you hide, sneak or ambush someone add +1 and take +1 focus on a hit.

Q
 When you intentionally drop your veil to reveal yourself for dramatic or surprising effect, foregoing its further use in this situation, take +2 focus.

Q
 Instead of disappearing, you alter other people's perception of you and how they see you. You can appear as someone specific ("Uncle Joe") or as a reflection of subjective concepts that could mean one thing for each person ("Caring Old Lady", "The Woman of Your Dreams").

### Weak Blood

8 *Nature.* Your body reacts differently to vampirism. You can eat, drink water, have sex and appear human in other ways without spending blood. Daylight does not harm you, but you still feel tired during the day and must spend 1 blood for each day (not night) scene you play. You have no fangs and must rely on sharp objects to draw blood from your victims. When you feed from someone, you always lose 1 focus no matter the result of your roll.

Q
 In some ways, time brought you even closer to your late humanity and to the mortals around you. Whenever you communicate with or read the emotions of humans, add +1 and take +1 focus on a hit.

Q

Q
 Being close to beasts strengthens your instincts. When you react or search by using your senses, you may roll +force instead of +intellect.

Q
 You can make your blood attract dangerous predators. When you do it and pour a few drops somewhere, beasts will immediately follow the smell and try to devour the blood.

## Background Connections

As you build relationships and complete quests in the service of others, you create connections. Connections provide narrative texture to your world by fleshing out other characters and communities. They give you places to return to, and people to reconnect with, when you don't know what to do. They also provide mechanical benefits in rolls. When you establish a new relationship with a character in your world, you track progress in a progress track that represents the development of your relationship and thrust. You can start your first section with up to three connections, but you must start with at least one: your progenitor - the vampire who turned you into one. 

For each connection you start with, you mark 1 progress according to their rank (this will be later explained in Progress Tracks.

## Condition Meters

Your character sheet has three condition meters: health, spirit, and blood. Their values are reduced when you face hardship, and increased when you recover adequately (see Harm, Stress and Hunger). They start at +5.

 **Health** represents your physical condition and stamina.

 **Spirit** is your morale and mental state.

 **Blood** represents how much your hunger for blood is sated.

### Impacts

Impacts represent temporary and permanent disadvantages. Each marked impact reduces your max focus by 1. Impacts also reduce your focus reset. If you have one marked impact, your focus reset is +1 (instead of +2). If you have more than one marked impact, your focus reset is 0 (instead of +2). Characters begin with all impacts unchecked.

#### Misfortunes

Misfortunes are temporary. They last until your character has adequate opportunity, resources, and time to recover.

 **Wounded** may be marked when you are at 0 health and suffer harm. You are severely injured.

 **Shaken** is marked when you are at 0 spirit and suffer stress. You are despairing or distraught. 

 **Starving** is marked when you are at 0 blood and lose blood. You are in a violent, hungry state. You lose 1 point of glamour and 1 of intellect.

#### Lasting Effects

Lasting effects are permanent. They forever impact your character through the focus adjustment and - more importantly - the narrative impact.

 **Permanently harmed** may be marked when you are *Wounded*, at 0 health, and suffer harm. You have suffered a wound that you must reckon with, such as the loss of an eye or hand, or bear physical scars that are a constant reminder of a harrowing incident. When this impact is marked, you have 0 health and you suffer more harm, you die your last death.

 **Traumatized** may be marked when you are *Shaken*, at 0 spirit and suffers stress. Your experiences have left you emotionally or mentally scarred. When this impact is marked, you have 0 health and you suffer more stress, your mind is forever lost.

 **Sinner** may be marked when you are *Starving*, at 0 blood and spend blood. You get so frenzied, you commit something that angers your ruler. Envision what it is and what she asks of you in exchange for letting you live. When this impact is marked, you have 0 blood and you spend more blood, you lose complete touch with your human side and turn into a beast.

## Creation Summary

Work through the following steps in whatever order you prefer.

 Envision your character. Choose a name.

 Set your stats by arranging these bonuses across your stats in any order: (7, 6, 6, 5, 5.)
 Set health, spirit, and blood to +5. Make note of any important equipment, weapon, or items.

 Set your focus to +2, your max focus to +10, and your reset to +2.

 Pick three assets (at least 1 power) Create up to three background connections. One must be with your progenitor.

 Set a background elegy, and give it a rank of formidable, extreme or epic. Then, envision your inciting incident and write a new elegy.

CHAPTER III: 
PLAYING 
THE GAME

## The Flow Of Play

Like most RPGs, you play from the perspective of your character. Your quests, and the characters and situations you encounter, will guide the fiction and the choices you make. When you have questions about what you find, how other characters in your world respond, or what happens next, you can go with what feels 

## The Action Roll

right. When you are seeking inspiration or want to put it in the hands of fate, you may ask the oracle. Use yes/no questions and the random prompts to generate interesting twists and new complications. Above all, if it's appealing, dramatic and fits the fiction, make it happen.

Whenever your character tries to do something dangerous, risky, challenging or dramatic, you have to make an Action Roll. Envision your approach and roll 2d10 (two ten-sided dice). Then, compare them to a stat (and other bonuses sometimes). The situation will tell you what stat to add. The total of your stat and any adds is your action score.

![30_image_0.png](30_image_0.png)

action score

There are three possible outcomes.

l l
 **Strong Hit:** Your action score beats (ties don't count) the value of both challenge dice. You succeed at what you are trying to do.

l f
 **Weak Hit:** Your action score beats only one of the challenge dice. You succeed, but with a cost or lesser effect.

f f
 **Miss:** Your action score doesn't beat either challenge die. You fail, or must make serious concessions.

Envision the current situation and what your

START
Ask and answer questions about the world, other characters, and what happens next 
(or *check the oracle*).

When your action or the current situation triggers a roll, make that roll.

![31_image_1.png](31_image_1.png)

What do you do next?

What happens next?

### How To Make An Action Roll

If you act… With stealth, speed, or **coordination:** Roll +**dexterity**. With courage, willpower, or **empathy:** Roll +**heart**. With aggression, strength, or **toughness:** Roll +**force**. With charm, composure, or **manipulation:** Roll +**glamour**. With expertise, focus, or **observation:** Roll +**intellect**. And if you are aided by… **A useful related asset:** consider the bonus it gives you (if any)
 **Someone else:** add another +1 to your roll (or +2 if you share a bond).

Then, roll the dice.

l l You succeed. Gain 
+1 focus, envision the positive consequences of your action and choose a fitting benefit.

l f You succeed, but not without trouble. Gain +1 focus, select one fitting benefit and one fitting cost.

f f You fail. Envision the negative outcomes of your action and select one fitting cost.

#### Benefits

 **Your wounds are healed:** gain +2 health or clear Wounded impact.

 **You feed:** gain +2 blood (+4 if you kill your victim) or uncheck Starving.

 You're feel calmer and more motivated: gain +2 spirit or clear the Shaken impact.

 You create or seize an opportunity: you or an ally gain +2 in the next related Action Roll You achieve something cool or dramatic: gain another +1 focus You harm a foe, develop a connection or advance in an elegy: mark progress (see Progress Tracks).

#### Costs

 **You are harmed or tired:** lose health according to the situation (see Harm)
 **You are stressed, scared,** 
intimidated or despaired: lose spirit according to the situation (see Stress)
 You spend blood and get hungrier: lose 1 blood (see Hunger)
 You are put in disadvantage or in trouble: lose 1 focus

### Match

If the values on your challenge dice are the same, you've rolled a match. You can use a match as a prompt to add a twist, create a new complication, or introduce a new peril:
l l Introduce an interesting twist or new opportunity.

f f Introduce a tough negative outcome, complication, or danger. If you're not sure what a match means for the current situation, you can ask the oracle. If you're still stuck for an idea, move on.

### Focus

Your focus value goes from -6 to +10 and represents your inertia, luck, and confidence. Burning focus is a way to deliver a decisive result or avoid failure. When you have positive focus, after you make an Action Roll, you may replace your action score with your current focus value. After you burn focus, you must reset your focus by immediately adjusting your focus meter to your focus reset value. The default reset is +2. This value is reduced when you suffer an impact. If you have one impact marked, your focus reset is +1. If you have more than one impact marked, your focus reset is 0.

When you have negative focus, you must reroll any die that hits a score lower than your focus. For example, when you make a roll at -3 focus and score an 8 and an 1, you must reroll the 1. You only need to do this once - if you score an 1 again, count it as a hit.

### Using Powers

Vampires have two innate supernatural abilities: **healing their wounds** and **appearing human for one** scene. Besides these, a vampire has access to powers granted by the power assets she possesses. To use a supernatural ability or power, you make an Action Roll based on the asset's associated stat. When you score a weak hit or a miss, you are forced to spend 1 blood. When you score a miss, the power is activated, but you must select a second cost.

#### Healing

When you have a few moments to stay in place, you can focus your inner power to restore health. This situation triggers an Action Roll. On any success, you restore points of health or (one or the other) clear the Wounded impact.

#### Appearing Human

You can focus your inner power to give the appearance of life to your undead body for up to a whole scene. This way, you are able to trick other people into believing you are a mortal. When appearing human, you may talk to people without making them suspicious, have intimate relationships, drink and eat and digest food.

### Rituals

Depending on your worldbuilding decisions, you may or may not include Rituals in your setting. We'll explore this in depth in Chapter IV: Your World). Rituals involve step-by-step activities with gestures, words, and objects, activating special and more specific supernatural powers. Like regular powers from assets, they use your life force for their effects, but they need a more specific setup - one tailored to each ritual. During character creation, you can choose up to three non-power assets, including any ritual assets. Consider the impact on your character's story when making these choices. How did she learn this ritual? Where did she find out about it?

New rituals can only be learned when it makes sense in the story - like having a mentor or finding instructions in a book. This applies to both entirely new rituals and different versions of the same ritual within a specific asset. Most ritual assets represent a group of rituals rather than just one.In the narrative, the target of a ritual always feels something strange is going on. If she's a vampire, she'll know for sure one was cast upon her - even though she can't tell what it does. To use a supernatural ability or power, you make an Action Roll based on the intelligence stat. On a **strong hit**, the ritual is successful. On a **weak hit** it is too, but it consumes you: lose 1 point of blood, health or spirit (pick 1). On a **miss,** roll on the list below. 1-20. The ritual has the opposite effect 21-40. It attracts mortal attention 41-60. It affects a different target 61-80. It has no effect, and you waste or lose resource needed to perform it again 81-00. It has no effect, and it consumes you: lose 2 point of blood, health or spirit (pick 1).

### Tips For Action Rolls

#### Fiction First, Then Mechanics

What are you trying to do? How are you doing it? What complications might you face? Envision it. If, after thinking through the fiction, you decide you are doing something or encountering a situation that is risky, challenging, or dramatic, roll the dice. Depending on the scale of the current action, you might be visualizing a montage of flashes (a quick hunt to feed) or the passing of a mere second (an intense fight). Always think from the standpoint of the fiction, even if it's obvious you'll do. Then, translate the fiction into the mechanics of a roll, and back to the fiction again as you play out the result.

#### Not Every Action Must Be Rolled

Don't let a session jump from roll to roll without any roleplay, worldbuilding, or storytelling. If you're doing something safe and certain, you probably don't need to roll. If you'd rather gloss over something, do it. Rolls offer a potential benefit and cost, and it's ultimately your decision whether to risk the roll to gain the reward. 

#### Making Group Rolls

When you are adventuring with allies (other player characters), you will often act to resolve a challenge for the group. This represents your character taking the lead in a particular scene. You might serve as the spokesperson as you persuade someone, for example. Unless an action specifically offers benefits for your allies, any mechanical bonus you gain from a hit is applied only to the character making the action or Conclusion Roll. For example, if you represent your group as you conclude an elegy and score a strong hit, you take the mechanical reward. Everyone else benefits from the narrative success. Allies can contribute to your action by making an Action Roll to help you. On a hit, you gain a bonus you can leverage to improve your chance of success. If more than one ally does this, bonuses can be stacked. When you act for your group and face a negative outcome, you should apply mechanical and narrative costs as appropriate to the current situation.

#### Make Rolls Matter

Let your rolls flow organically out of the narrative. Don't make them purely for a mechanical benefit without some support in the fiction. Don't repeat a roll trying to get your desired outcome. A roll, hit or miss, should always result in a change to the current situation. For example, you are trying to persuade an influential vampire to agree to an alliance. You roleplay how you attempt to reason with her. Then, you make the roll, and fail. She refused. Why? What else do you learn, or what do they do to make your situation more complex or dangerous? Whatever happens, something happens. You shouldn't try to persuade her again unless you bring a new approach or leverage to bear. However, there will be times when you make a roll multiple times in 

## Progress Tracks

A progress track measures your headway against a goal or obstacle, including quests, connections, and fights. Progress is tracked in three different situations: **Combat:** When you face an enemy in combat, a progress track represents your advantage as you weaken or wound your foes in the fight.

 **Connection:** When you establish a new relationship with a character in your world, a progress track represents the development of your relationship and thrust. Give them a role: whenever your connection aids you on an action closely associated with their role, add +1 and take +1 focus on a hit.

 **Elegy:** When you Sing an Elegy, a progress track represents the sequence. For example, in combat, you'll often attack with consecutive rolls. That's fine as long as the rolls don't get too mechanical. Break up the flow of play with other actions, narrative beats, and events that cause you to rethink your approach. When in doubt, follow this guideline: If you've made the same roll three times in a row, switch things up.

challenges you overcome on your way to achieving your ultimate goal. 

When you create a progress track, give the challenge a rank. In increasing order of severity, the ranks are troublesome, dangerous, formidable, extreme, and epic. Progress tracks are drawn as a row of ten boxes, which you fill in—or mark—as you make headway toward a goal. When you initiate a challenge, these boxes are empty.

![36_image_0.png](36_image_0.png)

### Marking Progress

When you make significant progress, fill in the appropriate number of ticks or progress boxes per the rank of your challenge. **Combat:** Mark progress when you harm your foe.

 **Connection:** Mark progress when you: sing or conclude an elegy for them; give them something of worth; share a profound moment; leverage their help in desperate circumstances; stand with them against hardship; or overcome a test of your relationship.

 **Elegy:** Mark progress when you: 
overcome a critical obstacle; gain meaningful insight; acquire a crucial item or resource; earn vital support; or defeat a notable foe.

### The Conclusion Roll

When it feels like you've made enough progress to achieve the objective you're tracking, you may attempt to conclude it. This is a Conclusion Roll. Roll the dice and compare their value to the number of filled boxes in the track (ignore stats, focus, and bonuses). 

#### Strong Hit

 **Combat:** You've defeated your enemy, and their fate is in your hands.

 **Connection:** You now share a bond. Give it a title as a trophy, mark experience, and pick one:
 Give her a new role When she aids you, add +2 and gain +1 focus on a hit.

 **Elegy:** Your quest is complete. 

Give it a title as a trophy and mark experience.

#### Weak Hit

 **Combat:** You achieve your objective, but not for free. Envision an appropriate trouble, disadvantage, or loss that comes from the situation.

 **Connection:** You share a bond, but they request something from you. To mark experience for this bond, sing an elegy for them and fulfill it.

 **Elegy:** Your promise is fulfilled, but there's more to do. If you sing an elegy to set things right, take full xp. Otherwise, take -1 xp.

#### Miss

 **Combat:** You are defeated, or your objective is lost. Envision an appropriate, dire outcome.

 **Connection:** They reveal a motivation or background that puts you at odds. If you recommit to this relationship, clear half your progress boxes and raise the connection's rank by one.

 **Elegy:** The goal is lost to you. 

Envision an appropriate, dire outcome. This also happens if you abandon an elegy.

### Experience

When you conclude an elegy or create a bond, you gain experience ponts per the challenge's rank: Troublesome: 1 xp; Dangerous: 2 xp; Formidable: 3 xp; Extreme: 4 xp; Epic: 5 xp. You gain no experience by simply beating foes. You spend earned experience to gain assets or upgrade those you already own. When you upgrade an asset, you may choose the options in whatever order. In other words, you don't need the second point in an asset to get the third. Assets cost 3 xp to buy and 2 xp to upgrade.

#### Sample Progress Tracks Troublesome

 **Progress marked:** 3 boxes
 **Elegies:** Challenging quests with few obstacles
 **NPCs:** Newborn vampires and average humans
 **Experience awarded:** 1 point

#### Dangerous

 **Progress marked:** 2 boxes
 **Elegies:** Involving quests with lots of obstacles
 **NPCs:** Young vampires, capable mortals
 **Experience awarded:** 2 points Formidable
 **Progress marked:** 1 box **Elegies:** Complex quests with many intimidating obstacles
 **NPCs:** Adult vampires, dangerous mortals and young werewolves
 **Experience awarded:** 3 points

#### Extreme

 **Progress marked:** 2 ticks
 **Elegies:** Overwhelming quests of staggering proportions
 **NPCs:** Elder vampires and adult werewolves
 **Experience awarded:** 4 points

#### Epic

 **Progress marked:** 1 tick **Elegies:** Unlife-defining quests of unknowable scope
 **NPCs:** Ancient vampires and elder werewolves
 **Experience awarded:** 5 points

# Harm, Stress And Hunger

### Harm

Harm represents physical damage and injuries. How much harm you suffer depends on the situation. When you face physical injury or hardship, you reduce your health track by the amount of harm suffered according to the situation or the rank of your foe. In combat, you deal and suffer harm according to the rank of your foe. Each point of harm you inflict is marked as progress on your foe's progress track. **Troublesome:** suffers 3 boxes per harm, deals 1 harm
 **Dangerous:** 2 boxes per harm, deals 2 harm
 **Formidable:** 1 box per harm, deals 2 harm
 **Extreme:** two tick per harm, deals 3 harm
 **Epic:** one tick per harm, deals 3 harm When you successfully attack a foe, you inflict harm according to what kind of weapon you are using. **1x harm:** Improvised weapons, light impact
 **2x harm:** Sharp weapons, gunshot, heavy impact, fire For example, when you wield a knife (doubles your harm) and attack a Dangerous enemy (takes 2 progress boxes per harm), you inflict 4 progress boxes of harm on a hit. When you are at 0 health and suffer harm, you must mark the Wounded impact. If this impact is already marked, you must mark Permanently Harmed. If this other impact is already marked, you face your final death (see Impacts). To heal yourself, you must activate your supernatural powers (see Healing). You can also clear the Wounded impact by doing so, but you cannot do both in the same roll.

### Optional Rules

Depending on the decisions you make when building your world, (which we will delve into in Chapter IV: Your World) you may or may not include damage by holy water, garlic, etc. If you do so, consider the appropriate optional rule below.

#### Superstitions

When you opt to include superstitions in your universe, foes who use garlic, sacred symbols and holy water against you in combat are deadlier. When they deal damage, you suffer +1 harm. In other words, a troublesome foe who throws holy water at you deals damage as if it was dangerous.

#### Authentic Faith

Authentic Faith is a true and resilient belief in a higher power that you can choose to incorporate in your universe. If so, when a foe wield a symbol of a higher power they deeply believe in (a crucifix, for example), she is treated as she was one rank more powerful.

### Stress

Stress represents mental burdens and trauma. When you face hardships that test your psychological endurance, reduce your spirit track according to the situation. You also suffer stress when someone intimidates or frightens you.

 **1 stress:** An unsettling or frustrating incident.

 **2 stress:** A distressing or upsetting incident.

 **3 stress:** A horrifying or demoralizing incident.

 **4 stress:** A traumatic or heartrending incident.

 **5 stress:** A soul-shattering incident, loss of all hope.

When you're at 0 spirit and suffers stress, you must mark the Shaken impact. If this impact is already marked, you must mark Traumatized. If this other impact is already marked, you face desolation (see Impacts).

#### Respite

To recover spirit points or remove the Shaken impact (one or the other), you must make an action roll to socialize, share intimacy, or find a moment of peace.

### Hunger

Hunger represents how much a vampire feels the need to feed. They always spend 1 blood when scoring a weak hit or miss while trying to:
 Awake each sunset Appear human for a scene Use a supernatural power Heal wounds and restore health The hungrier a vampire is, the closer she is to losing her self-control and committing something that threatens the Façade.

When you have 0 blood and have to spend more, you must mark the Starving impact. If it is already marked, mark the Sinner one. If you already marked it, your mind is lost forever (see Impacts).

#### Feeding

To recover spirit blood or remove the Starving impact (one or the other), you must feed from mortals (or other sources, if you have adequate assets).

## Using Oracles

### Seeking Answers

You can ask the oracle to help guide your game session and trigger ideas when you need to know what happens next. Its most basic function is to answer a "yes or no" question. Combined with your own instincts and creativity, this (and other random prompts) can push your story in surprising and exciting directions. 

### Asking The Oracle

When you seek to resolve questions, discover details in the world, determine how other characters act, or trigger events, you may…
 **Draw a conclusion:** Decide the answer based on the most interesting and obvious result.

 **Ask a yes/no question:** Decide the odds of a 'yes', and roll on the table to the right to check the answer. 

 **Pick two:** Envision two options. 

Rate one as 'likely', and roll on the table to the right to see if it is true. If not, it is the other.

 **Spark an idea:** Brainstorm or use a random prompt.

#### Yes/No

| Odds are...    | Yes on...      |
|----------------|----------------|
| Almost certain | 11 or greater  |
| Likely         | 26 or greater  |
| 50/50          | 51 or greater  |
| Unlikely       | 76 or greater  |
| Small chance   | 91 or greater. |

On a match, an extreme result or twist has occurred.

### More Randomness

You'll find a set of random tables in the last chapter. These provide inspirational prompts and random results for common situations. You can also use whatever random generators you prefer, including those drawn from another game, online generators, or visual tools such as tarot cards.

### Trust Your Instincts

These random generators will never replace your own imagination and intuition. If it's interesting, dramatic, and pushes the story forward, make it happen. Too much reliance on random generators to answer questions about "what happens next" can kill the focus of your game or make it feel disconnected and incoherent. Keep it moving.

## Other Characters

The mechanics of Elegy almost entirely reference your character. Other non-player characters (NPCs) have a single stat (their rank) which represents how powerful or dangerous they are. Rank is taken into account when you fight or make a connection with NPCs. Further, NPCs do not roll dice to determine the outcome of their actions. If you have questions about an NPC's motivations or what they do next, ask the oracle.

### Connections

As you explore your world and complete quests, you create connections with people, which represent your current relationship. Connections give you advantages for relevant rolls when interacting with those you have connected with. Each connection is tracked in a progress track that's ranked according to the character's rank.

## Multiplayer

Elegy is primarily a solo game, but you can play it with more people if you want. There are two modes of multiplayer:
 **Guided:** One or more players take the role of their characters, the protagonists in your story, while a gamemaster (GM) moderates the session. The GM helps bring the world to life, portrays the characters you encounter, and makes decisions about the outcome of your actions.

 **Cooperative (Co-Op):** You and one or more friends play together to overcome challenges and complete quests. A GM is not required. The Elegy game system will help you explore the dramatic stories of your characters and their.

When multiple player characters share a same objective (a mission, for example), they also share the same progress track. You can see more insights on multiplaying Elegy in the Gameplay in Depth chapter.

# Optional Rule: Moves

Moves are, essentially, rolls adapted for specific narrative situations. You can use them, only if you wish, in place of Action or Conclusion Rolls when situations permit. For instance, if you're persuading someone, you can either make an Action Roll and adapt its benefits and costs to the scene or, if you prefer, opt for the *Compel* move. The difference lies in the fact that the Action Roll is a one-size-fits-all tool that can be performed in any context quickly; on the other hand, *Compel* offers a roll precisely designed for persuasion contexts, providing you with more ideas on how to navigate that specific situation. When you see a move name Italicized like this in another move's description, it means you have to make it. For example, every time you get a miss in a move, you'll be prompted to Pay the Price. That means that you'll have to make the *Pay the Price* move. Another difference in moves is that marking impacts or progress on a progress track is dependent on specific moves now. When you're prompted to mark progress, mark it on the track related to what you're trying to accomplish 
(see Progress Tracks).

When you try to **persuade someone** 
or make them an offer, envision your approach. If you…
 Charm or lie: Roll +**glamour** Threaten or incite: Roll +**force**
 Pacify or encourage: Roll +**heart** On a **strong hit**, they'll do what you want or agree to your conditions. Take +1 focus.

roll +**Glamour**.

On a **strong hit**, the power is activated successfully. Take 1 focus. On a **weak hit**, the power is activated successfully, but you get hungrier. Spend 1 blood. On a **miss**, you get hungrier and the power is activated, but not without consequences. Spend 1 blood and Pay the Price.

#### Perform Ritual

Then, roll +**intellect**. On a **strong hit**, the ritual is performed successfully. Take 1 focus. On a **weak hit**, the ritual is performed successfully, but it consumes the blood within you. Spend 1 blood.

#### Advance

When you focus on your skills, receive training, find inspiration or earn a reward, you may spend 3 xp to add a new asset, or 2 xp to upgrade one. The chosen asset must be framed within fiction and make sense in the context. For example, if you're by yourself without any access to blood sorcery knowledge, you can't learn or upgrade a ritual asset.

#### Heal

When you spend a few seconds in place and use your supernatural abilities to heal yourself, roll +force.

On a **strong hit**, the care is helpful. If you are wounded, clear the impact and take or give +2 health. Otherwise, take +3 health. Spend 1 blood. On a **weak hit**, as above, but the recovery costs extra time or resources. Choose one: lose 2 focus and spend 1 blood or spend 2 blood.

#### Respite

When you socialize, share intimacy, or find a moment of peace, roll 
+**heart**.

On a **weak hit**, follow the same steps as above, but your connection seeks something more first.

CHAPTER IV: 
YOUR WORLD

### Vampirism

Vampirism is a supernatural condition of unknown origin. Vampires are unliving humans created when a vampire drains a person of blood and then feeds the corpse a few drops of their own vampiric blood. The vampire who turns a mortal into another of her kind is called the progenitor; while the newborn vampire is called the *progeny*. The act of creating another vampire is called embracement.

### Blood

Blood is vampire's only nourishment. They don't have to (and actually can't) eat food or drink beverage. To feed, most vampires prey on humans, although there are those that drink the blood of animals. Vampires spend blood to awaken every sunset. They can also do it when they activate their special powers, appear human for some moments or heal their wounds. When blood is spent, vampires risk getting hungry. When they have no blood in their system, they go into an entranced rage until they feed again.

### Appearance

Although their bodies won't rot, vampires are indistinguishable from corpses. They can, however, assume a human appearance (blush, retract their fangs, warm their body) whenever they need, if they spend their blood. This aside, they're just as diverse as living people.

### Weaknesses

Vampires get extremely tired during the day. At this time, most of them sleep. Fire, sunlight and the claws and fangs of supernatural creatures may inflict fatal injuries. 

### The Kiss

The kiss is how vampires refer to the act of feeding directly from a mortal. Vampires do not need to kill to get blood. When a mortal is kissed, they go into an ecstatic trance, and in the end they have no recollection of the incident. A vampire closes the bite wounds on the victim's neck by simply licking them.

### Substances

When a mortal has substances in their blood (alcohol, poison, etc.), the vampire who drinks from them will suffer the substance's effects.

### The Façade

If mortals found out that vampires exist, they would hunt them all down. To survive, vampires must keep their existence a secret from mortals. The Façade is the set of laws that protects this secret. There's three main laws: 1. You must hide your vampiric nature from mortals 2. Creating other vampires is an act of great responsibility and should not be done without the permission of the queen 3. You must not drink the blood of other vampires Breaking these laws is not just a crime, but a taboo. Because of that, most vampiric societies and organizations enforce them.

### The Feudal City

Vampires organize they society almost in a feudalistic way, basing they hierarchy on the city and its ruler, the queen. The queen is the official ruler of a city. She has advisors and helpers, and divides the city in territories among several minor rulers who have effective rule over their jurisdiction. Each city is not only independent from one another, but also geographically isolated since long travels (specially during the day) can be deadly to vampires. The main governing body of the vampiric society is called Olympus.

### Progenitor And Progeny

Traditionally, the progenitor is expected to guide and mentor the new vampire, helping them acclimate to their new existence as a member of the vampire society and instructing them in the laws and customs of vampire society. Progenitors are often responsible for their progeny's actions, especially during the early years of the progeny's existence. If a progeny causes trouble, the progenitor may face consequences as well. The emotional dynamics between progenitor and progeny can vary widely. Some progenitor-progeny relationships are supportive and nurturing, while others can be strained or even antagonistic. Betrayals, rivalries, and conflicts within a vampiric family (a group of vampires created by the same progenitor) are common. Vampires turn to their progenitors for orientation, but also receive responsibilities and missions from them.

### Reasons For Embracement

An embracement usually (but not always) happens because of one of eight reasons: 
 **Survival:** The embracement happens as a means of survival for an individual who is near death or facing imminent danger.

 **Desire for Progeny:** The embracement happens to ensure a legacy. This can be driven by a desire for companionship or loyalty.

 **Political Maneuvering:** The embracement grants political influence to the progenitor. The newborn can be a valuable asset in vampire politics.

 **Philosophical Reasons:** The embracement happens based on philosophical beliefs. The progenitor seeks someone who aligns with her worldview.

 **Cruelty:** The embracement is a punishment for a mortal. The progenitor condemns the newborn into the vampiric condition for amusement or manipulation.

 **Blood Linking:** The desire for a blood link, a powerful and mystical connection of loyalty and obedience, can motivate an embracement.

 **Hunger:** Sometimes, an embracement is accidental and impulsive, driven by an immediate need for blood and lack of control.

 **Allure of the Embrace:**
Mortals may actively seek out the embracement, enticed by the allure of immortality, supernatural abilities, or the promise of a new existence. This can occur willingly or through manipulation by a potential progenitor.

### Blood Linking

When a vampire drinks from another, she develops a deep, artificial affection called *blood link* for the vampire whose blood was drunk. These feelings get stronger with each drink, and three draughts are enough to produce the deepest adoration. Mortals and other creatures are susceptible to the same effects. The vampire who drinks from another is called the *linked*. The one who is drunk is called the *provider*. Every vampire is linked to her progenitor. The linked constantly feels artificial love and loyalty, even if simultaneously hating the provider. Many progenitors create blood links with their children to control them, and many queens impose them on criminals. 

Breaking the blood link is difficult. It always lasts one year from the last drink before slowly wearing off. The death of the provider is the only escape from it. Vampires might deliberately share their blood with each other to revel in the addictive properties of the blood link, sometimes even doing it to become immune to other links. No matter how uncommon this is, it is frowned upon by most vampires, seen as a twisted and decadent practice. Blood links have three levels: 
 First Level: You wish to impress, be accepted by and be closer to your provider.

 Second Level: You deeply care about your provider and go out of your way to please or aid her.

 Third Level: You feel a deep emotional connection, loyalty, and dependency, becoming almost like a slave. You are completely immune to the blood link of others, breaking every lesser blood link you might have.

### Neutral Grounds

Neutral Grounds are places chosen by the queen to act as locations for vampire gatherings and social events. She queen also names a keeper for each one of them, who plays the role of manager and host. 

Because the gathering of so many vampires at the same place might risk the Façade, the security in a Neutral Ground is always rigorously enforced. Cities usually have at least one neutral ground per distric.

### Elegy

To sing an elegy means to promise to accomplish something in dedication to a person or ideal. It is a reverence to the grief born from the demise of every soul that leaves a vampire behind; a vow vampires make each other, or themselves, over their own mourning.

## Your Truths

Truths are the bricks you build your unique world with. For each category in this section, choose one of the options (or make your own) and make it true for your vampire world. Your choices set the background and tone of your stories, and may even inspire different elegies. If you think none of the sample truths in a category correspond to the way you envision your world, feel free to adapt them or even create your own.

### History

Vampires inhabit Santa Maria since its early development, which happened…

#### Q …In The Dark Ages.

Santa Maria was a crucial trading post situated at the crossroads of major medieval trade routes. It soon became a hub for commerce and cultural exchange, full of prosperity.

Quest starter: Rumors are circulating about an ancient artifact that once belonged to a powerful vampire in the Middle Ages, believed to be hidden somewhere in Santa Maria. Retrieving this artifact could earn you the respect of your elders. What is this artifact? What's its origin? Where is it said to be? What guards it?

#### Q …Somewhere Between The 16Th And The 19Th Century.

Fueled by the advancements of the Industrial Revolution, Santa Maria became known for its factories and innovations in manufacturing. The city was pivotal in shaping the era's economic landscape, drawing a growing population seeking employment.

Quest starter: Legend says a gun that belonged to an old ruler in Santa Maria is being kept in a museum. This gun was used to kill many vampires a few centuries ago, and it would make a great trophy. Who convinces you to steal it? 

#### Q …At The Beginning Of The 20Th Century.

Santa Maria embodied the dynamism of a new era. Positioned as a cultural melting pot, it became a hub for cultural movements, scientific breakthroughs, and the pursuit of new ideas.

Quest starter: It is said that a build]ing designed by a vampire architect at the turn of the century contains hidden chambers that hold some kind of treasure. What does this building serve as? Why do you agree to invade and investigate it?

### Origins

It is widely accepted that vampirism is…
Q
 **…a genetic mutation, and vampires are their own species.**
Ages ago, vampires already believed they were integral to the balance of the world's ecosystem, if not in a natural way, in a supernatural one.

Quest starter: A renowned biologist is conducting an experiment on vampire blood, threatening the Façade. How do you get involved in this situation? How do you plan to silence her?

#### Q …A Punishment For Humanity'S Original Sins.

The curse unfolded when the first murder occurred, and a higher power condemned the killer and her descendants, ensuring they would never again walk under the sun. This marked the origin of the first vampire.

Quest starter: A cryptic parchment telling the story of the first murder has been found. It's in a strange language, and it seems to reveal new details of the story. How will you translate it? What details are these?

#### Q …An Eternal Enigma.

Even the most enlightened vampires harbor conflicting opinions on this matter. Each individual's perspective significantly shapes their interpretation, and there is no definitive answer to this question.

Quest starter: Vampires form a cult around the idea that it's possible to turn back into mere humans, but mortal authorities suspect something is not right with them. Why do you step in this situation?

### Superstitions

Q
 **Most of what you heard about vampires is untrue.**
They are not deterred by crucifixes, garlic, or holy water, and they can enter private domains without invitation. Astake through the heart merely paralyzes them.

Quest starter: A suspicious mortal is guarding a place with garlic and crosses. While she is clearly superstitious, she seems to be holding something of importance within said place. What gives it away? How do you get yourself involved in discovering what it is? What is this place?

#### Q They Reflect The Real Deal.

They're not superstitions. Garlic, holy water, crucifixes, and other religious symbols are actually harmful to vampires. A stake to the heart will kill them, and they can't enter a home or private domain if they're not invited to. *This* alternative enables the Superstition optional damage rule in page 40.

Quest starter: Garlic gas was released in the ventilation system of your progenitor. Who is the culprit? Why does she want to harm your progenitor?

#### Q Religious Symbols Are Dangerous In The Hands Of Actually Faithful People.

Authentic Faith is a supernatural force rooted in sincere, unwavering belief in a higher power, be it a religious deity or a philosophical concept. Mortals with Authentic Faith who wield divine symbols are capable of warding off and even hurting supernatural creatures, particularly vampires. A stake to the heart will paralyze a vampire. This alternative enables the Authentic Faith optional damage rule in page 41.

Quest starter: A visiting bishop in Santa Maria plans to bless the water in a large fountain, transforming it into a potent weapon against your kind. How will you stop her, considering she always carry with herself a sacred symbol that can harm you? What symbol is this?

### Genealogy

Q
 **Depending on their progenitor, each vampire belongs to one of five** 
different lineages.

Every vampire is affiliated with one of several "families," each characterized by distinct traditions and manifestations of vampirism. Lineages are transmitted when one vampire creates another, with each lineage embodying a specific archetype of the vampire myth, bestowing unique powers and inclinations. Members of a lineage may not necessarily resemble or behave like each other. This alternative enables the Lineages optional rule in page 76.

Quest starter: A vampire serial killer is targeting victims of a specific lineage. Which one is it, and why? What compels you to step forward and go after her?

#### Q All Vampires Are Unique And Different From One Another.

Vampirism manifests in what seems like a random manner, and each vampire is a unique entity with its own set of features.

Quest starter: A newborn vampire went missing. You know she had a unique ability, which should help you track her. What ability is this? Why do you swear to find the newborn?

#### Q Vampires Inherit One Power From Their Progenitor.

While powers may develop in a more diverse fashion over time, all new vampires begin their undead existence inheriting one special ability from their progenitor. This ability is random.

Quest starter: Two newborn vampires don't know where they come from, but believe their share the same progenitor. What power do they share? Why do you agree to help? Who is the progenitor?

### What Mortals Know

Q
 While it's not exactly legal, it's not uncommon for vampires to have human allies of some sort.

Having connections with individuals possessing valuable skills or occupying influential positions is advantageous, whether one is undead or not. However, it's crucial to exercise caution. Before disclosing your true nature, ensure that these individuals have a significant stake in maintaining your secret, that revealing the truth about you won't be easily believed by others, and that they don't intend to harm you.

Quest starter: A friendly mortal contact begs you to find her child, who has been kidnapped. How will you track down the culprits? Where is she? Do you ask something in return?

#### Q Secret Organizations Know Vampires Exist, And Hunters Are A Threat.

While vampires may go unnoticed by the majority, certain secret societies possessing occult knowledge remain vigilant. Among them are black ops agencies dedicated to unveiling the vampiric nature, alongside centuries-old religious circles committed to eradicating every monstrous entity. Investigators, spies, vampire hunters, and paramilitary units pose a tangible threat to the vampire community. This alternative gives access to the Mortal Threats NPCs.

Quest starter: Vampires are being killed in a serial fashion that seems to be the work of a skilled vampire killer. What's her modus operandi? How do you intend to catch her? What's in it for you?

#### Q Basically No One Knows Vampires Exist.

Beside mannequins - the human blood bags some vampires have - the Façade requires absolute secrecy and is enforced in a very efficient way. Those who know too much are immediately silenced.

Quest starter: Someone took pictures of you while you were feeding. This could mean a devastating blow to the Façade and a sentence for you. How can you prevent them from causing this damage? Where can you find the photographer? Who is behind all this?

### The Internet

Q
 **Using the internet is prohibited by law.**
In today's world, no information is truly secure. A single slip, and the Façade will crumble.

Quest starter: A ghost hunting YouTube show crew just got actual vampire activity on camera. What did they capture? How will you protect the Façade from them?

#### Q Using The Internet Is Permitted.

As long as you keep your unnatural habits away from social media and use fake accounts, you may use the internet however you want.

Quest starter: A couple of young vampires share their unlives openly in social media. Why do you step in to stop them? What's the last Façade-breaking thing they tweeted?

#### Q Vampires Have Their Own Network, The Umbernet.

Even though regular internet use is prohibited, the umbernet links all major vampire cities in a secure web, resistant to mortal interference and private. While it doesn't encompass all the information available on the internet, its functionality is similar.

Quest starter: Sensitive documents of one of your acquaintances were leaked from the umbernet to the internet. How do you intend to investigate this case? What does she promise you in return for your aid in finding the culprit?

### Rebels

Q
 **Plenty of vampires don't agree totally with the queen, and sometimes** 
they form groups.

These groups can be united by any social or political idea. The bigger ones can even have some influence, but they are never powerful enough to actually challenge the queen.

Quest starter: A small group of vampires is accusing and exposing a corrupt, bloodthirsty captain they want to take down. Why is taking part in this situation important to you? Who do you support?

#### Q Those Who Don'T Agree With The Queen'S Rule Will Be Silenced Or Punished.

The queen's law is absolute. Any organized political divergence from the traditions that hold her in power is a threat that must be eliminated.

Quest starter: Your progenitor was accused of conspiring against the queen. Written evidence that connects her to a radical group was found, but she swears the letters are forged. Who is the culprit?

Q
 The Agorean Movement is an independent Faction that questions the queen's authority and governs part of Santa Maria.

They advocate for individual freedom and self-governance, and resist the constraints of the queen's law. While their ranks include diverse ideologies, from idealists to nihilists, the common thread among them is a desire to challenge authority, question ancient traditions, and create a more egalitarian and liberated existence for vampires. This alternative gives access to the Agorean Movement NPCs.

Quest starter: A Agorean militant believes her collective's leader is a spy from the Olympus. Why does she trust you to uncover her leader's true colors? What does this collective fight for?

### Blood Sorcery

Q
 **The powers of blood don't manifest themselves through silly rituals**
While some individuals may follow peculiar esoteric traditions, the concept of vampiric blood sorcery is nonexistent in our world. Rituals are not a part of our reality.

Quest starter: A vampire is conducting mystical ceremonies involving animal sacrifice. The disappearance of numerous animals are making mortal society suspicious. How do you make her stop? What is her favorite animal to sacrifice, and why?

Q
 Vampires who know blood sorcery rituals are rare, but often powerful and wise.

They keep out of sight, so their methods stay secret, but they sometimes take vampires as pupils when they are worthy.

Quest starter: Rumors say there's an elder in Santa Maria who could teach you rituals - if you manage to find and convince her. Why are you so eager to be her apprentice? Where will you start looking for her?

#### Q The Circle Of Circe Is A Large, Influential Group Of Vampire Mystics.

They are meticulous in their studies, developing complex rituals, and mastering the manipulation of supernatural forces. Their focus on the arcane arts gives them a reputation for being scholars and guardians of occult knowledge within the vampire society. *This alternative gives access to the Circle of Circe NPCs*.

Quest starter: A bag of werewolf blood has been located in the local medical clinic. This not only endangers the Façade, as it would make a potent concoction for rituals, according to the vampire that contacts you. Why are you trusted with this quest? What do you get in return?

### Religion

#### Q The Government Has Tones Of Faith.

The most important practices are held in a cult-like fashion, and the queen and other important figures act as priestesses in these situations. It's something purely ceremonial, but it reflects the idea that the queen and her peers are more than simple vampires.

Quest starter: An important ceremony that will happen soon requires half the blood of at least 3 mortals. Why does the queen trust you with to collect it?

#### Q The Epitaph Order Is A Large And Influential Religious Organization.

Quest starter: A local mortal preacher has been saying things that go against the Epitaph Order's ideals. What commandment do they inspire humans to break? Why do you agree to silence her?

A few make prayers and have group meetings, but they have no political influence.

Quest starter: A vampire who was devoutly religious in life now attends nightly ceremonies associated with her former faith, drawing the curiosity of mortals who sense something's wrong about her. What's giving away she's not like them? How do you prevent her nature from being discovered by others?

### Deviance

Q
 **Vampires rarely break the three moral laws buried within their nature.**
Everybody has heard of a vampire drinking the blood of another, turning mortals into vampires without thinking twice, or even revealing their nature despite the risk, but they're really abnormal cases.

Quest starter: You hear rumors of a group of vampires killing others to use their vampiric blood to conduct dark, esoteric rites. What's their story? What do they seek through these rites? Why do you swear to stop them?

Q
 **Vampires who create blood links with others of their kind or even** 
mortals are common.

They usually do it to establish a relationship of dominance and influence over the other individual.

Quest starter: A nightclub owner is compelling her human employees to drink her blood, binding them as servants through blood linking. They exhibit extreme submissiveness towards her, but tensions arise as they begin to compete for their employer's favor. Why do you intervene in this situation?

### Werewolves

Q
 **They live in packs within the city and call themselves lycanthropes.**
Werewolves are another type of creature that hides in the night. Vampires and them are not necessarily enemies: sometimes, they cooperate to keep their existences in the shadows. *This alternative gives access to the Lycanthrope NPCs*.

### Elegies

The precious promises vampires make one another…
Q
 **…are documents written on paper and marked with a drop of blood.**
It can be a letter paper, a notebook page or even a napkin. Regardless of the material, it is treated as a contract. After singing an elegy, a vampire sheds a drop of blood on it and hands it to the one to whom she has sworn - or puts it in a safe place if she made the promise to herself.

Quest starter: Your progenitor writes her elegies in a special paper collection she owns. However, this collection was unfortunately stolen. What will you do to the culprit? Why is this collection so important?

#### Q …Are Made Verbally And Contemplated In Meditation.

Elegies are crafted like any promise, whether written or spoken. The vampire who creates one dedicates a few minutes to half an hour in silence and solitude, concentrating on it and visualizing its fulfillment.

Quest starter: According to your progenitor, the mummified hand of an ancient vampire is somewhere in Santa Maria.

## Lineages

This optional system is used when you include lineages in your truths (see Genealogy Truths). When you include lineages in your game, every vampire belongs to one of several "families" with particular traditions and manifestations of vampirism. Lineages are passed on when one vampire creates another. Each lineage reflects one archetype of the vampire myth, granting them different powers and inclinations. They don't act, or sometimes even look, like each other. Creating characters when you play using lineages has a few twists. The first thing you must do is select your lineage.

 Each one has access to four (and only four) power assets, and one of these powers must be chosen as one of your three starting assets.

 Besides, your lineage dictates which stats can be your highest. It gives you two options: set one to +7 and the other to +6.

### Adamas Lineage (The Adamant)

## The City Of Santa Maria

Santa Maria is the default setting for Elegy. It comes with specific details that offer you a quick, rich and efficient background for your urban unlife. Still, you may customize the city of your game however you want: add new districts, places or landmarks, decide where in the world it's settled, replace its name, or even base it on a real city.

### Welcome To Santa Maria

Santa Maria, a city of dark allure and hidden secrets, stands as a beacon of intrigue and danger. Nestled within its borders are six distinct districts, each with its own unique flavor and undercurrents of supernatural power. From the bustling urban center of Downtown, where mortal and immortal life intertwine amidst towering skyscrapers, to the tranquil and deceptive calm of the Suburbia District, where vampire rivalries simmer beneath the facade of suburban bliss. The Waterfront District entices with its vibrant coastal atmosphere, while the Old Town District exudes the weight of history and ancient bloodlines. 

The Industrial District echoes with gritty resilience, harboring hidden operations and outcast vampires. Finally, the University District serves as an intellectual hub, where academia and esoteric knowledge collide.

CHAPTER V: 
NPCS

## Npcs

NPCs in your game are characters other than your own and those of fellow players. They can be people, beings, or creatures. You roleplay interactions and act to influence, aid, gain help, or act against them. This chapter provides sample NPCs organized by category, offering many starting points. Choose what suits your version of Santa Maria, considering your Truths. Customize as you wish, shaping your world according to your preferences.

### Components Of An Npc

In Elegy gameplay, your character's abilities and actions take center stage, and NPCs are portrayed through fiction rather than mechanics. They lack stats, assets, or tracks. Sample NPCs offer broad details guiding their power in combat and social influence. Envision their personality and motivations during interactions. If uncertain, consult the oracle for characteristics or actions. Then, act accordingly based on your vision.

### Rank

NPCs have a single mechanical attribute, their rank, which represents how long it takes to create a bond with them and how much harm they deal and take in combat. They are also able to cause harm to your Spirit (stress) equal to their rank when they frighten or demoralize you, for example.

Elevate the rank by one (up to a maximum of epic) for exceptionally powerful NPCs. Conversely, lower the rank by one (to a minimum of troublesome) for less formidable adversaries.

 **Traits** are the common personality and appearance associated with each NPC
 **Drives** are their typical objectives
 **Features** are the usual tools they will use to achieve them, including supernatural powers and combat skills. They also represent what resource or assistance the character may offer if, for example, you fulfill elegies for them or aid them in accomplishing their objectives.

It's important to note that while these characteristics encapsulate average stereotypes, they do not universally apply over every individual within the diverse Santa Maria. All NPCs include a quest starter, which can serve as inspiration for your elegies.

### Npc Packs

When facing a group of foes, streamline progress tracking by combining them into a single progress track called a pack. This simplifies the process and speeds up the scene. Increase the pack's rank to reflect their collective ability to deal and withstand harm. For a small pack (around 3 to 5), raise the rank by one; for a larger pack (approximately 6 to 10), increase it by two. Facing more than 10 troublesome or dangerous foes? Group them into smaller packs. Envision appropriate consequences when inflicting harm on the pack - wounding, incapacitating, or driving some foes back. Successfully ending the fight indicates defeating the last opponent or breaking their fighting spirit. Note that formidable, extreme, and epic foes must each have their own progress track and cannot be grouped into a pack.

### Joining Forces With Npcs

When your story involves collaborating with helper NPCs to surmount challenges, it's crucial to assess their impact on the narrative and your actions. Treat them as characters, not mere numbers, by asking the oracle about their responses, performance in challenges, or next actions. Transform them into dynamic entities by assigning personalities, quirks, and motivations. Let them weave into your story and quests, influencing outcomes for better or worse. However, maintain focus on your character and allies throughout the narrative.

### Creating Npcs

Craft NPCs that align with your vision of Santa Maria, enhancing your narrative and enriching your character's adventures. Use the provided sample NPCs as a starting point, or create entirely new characters. Since NPCs lack mechanical details, it's easy to bring them to life without extensive preparation. When engaging in combat with an NPC, assign them a rank, and optionally note their traits, drives, and features. Beyond that, their motivations, abilities, and actions are entirely shaped by your storytelling. 

NPCs can choose to ignore, aid, or oppose your character. For recurring NPCs, take note of what you learn about them over time, particularly if you share a bond with them. Here are some sample NPCs you may encounter in Santa Maria. They are categorized into groups, some of which may or may not exist in your universe (refer to Your Truths). These characters represent common or prominent figures with varying degrees of power and hierarchical influence. When including them in your narrative, you don't need to limit yourself to the sample characteristics: you can give a vampire as many supernatural abilities as you see fit, for example.

Below are the average ranks for various types of NPC.

 **Troublesome:** Newborn vampires and average humans. 3 progress/harm. Inflicts 1 harm.

 **Dangerous:** Young vampires, capable mortals. 2 progress per harm. Inflicts 2 harm.

 **Formidable:** Adult vampires, dangerous mortals and young werewolves. 1 progress per harm. Inflicts 2 harm.

 **Extreme:** Elder vampires and adult werewolves. 2 ticks per harm. Inflicts 3 harm.

 **Epic:** Ancient vampires and elder werewolves. 1 tick/harm. Inflicts 3 harm.

In what secluded location does she typically reside?

## Olympus

The Olympus stands as the governing body of the vampire society, emphasizing order, hierarchy, and the concealment of vampiric existence. As the self-proclaimed keepers of the Façade, the Olympus seeks to maintain the delicate balance between the undead and mortal worlds. Its strict feudal structure mirrors the social order of medieval times and emphasizes the importance of tradition and respect for authority. The Olympus operates with a veneer of civility and sophistication. Diplomacy, political maneuvering, and social etiquette are prized skills, and conflicts are often resolved through negotiation rather than open warfare. Ceremonies within the Olympus are frequently formal and steeped in tradition. The neutral grounds, where vampires can gather without fear of violence, exemplify its commitment to structured social interactions. These aspects reinforce the sense of unity and loyalty within the group. These are a few sample vampires that hold titles within the Olympus.

### Queen

Extreme. The queen is the prestigious ruling authority of the city within the Olympus. She is responsible for enforcing the Façade, resolving internal disputes and maintaining the traditions of Olympus. In your version of Santa Maria, she might also be a spiritual leader that symbolizes a higher power (see Religion Truths).

The queen's hand entrusts you with the mission of finding her. What happened to her?

## Agorean Movement

The Agorean Movement is a rebellious group that rejects the rigid structure of the Olympus. Seeking to reform the system from within, they challenge the status quo through activism and a commitment to diversity. The movement values individuality, and their members frequently forge their own paths, resisting the constraints of traditional vampiric society. The Agorean mode of operation focuses on activism, political maneuvering, and community building. They use their collective strength to challenge oppressive structures and promote the idea that all vampires should have a say in the governance of their society. Instead of elaborate ceremonies, Agorean members often engage in open forums and debates to discuss their vision for a more equitable vampiric society. Their emphasis is on open communication and collaboration to bring about change peacefully. These are a few sample vampires within the Agorean Movement. To decide if you want to include this group in your setting, see the Rebel Truths.

### Director

Formidable. The leader of the Agorean movement is, in practice, its "queen". A director lacks the strength and respect from the title, yet holds significant responsibilities. She is voted by the majority and is not necessarily the oldest or most powerful vampire of the group. Some directors are motivated by a genuine sense of civic duty to the movement, while others seek power within the sect, using their position to acquire favors and influence.

 Confident demeanor Drives Liberate vampires from the oppresive Olympus Keep authority Features Influence over mortal institutions Magnetic charisma Quest starter: Someone sent a mortal with poisoned blood to the director.

Traits Street-smart clothing Drives Educate younger Kindred about the oppressive nature of the Olympus Organize protests

 Firearm Enhanced strength Quest starter: You are accused of killing an Agorean member in their territory. How do you prove your innocence to the director?

## Egregoros

The Egregoros stands as a rebellious group that rejects the norms and conventions of the Olympus. Instead of concealing their supernatural nature, they embrace it unabashedly. This defiance contributes to their reputation as monstrous and chaotic beings. They also deny the feudal structure of the Olympus, advocating instead for a more anarchic and fluid system. While this leads to a seemingly chaotic organization, it reflects the Egregoros's commitment to personal freedom and resistance against oppressive hierarchies. The Egregoros's modus operandi is characterized by aggression and combat. They revel in their predatory instincts, embracing the savagery inherent in their vampiric nature. This often manifests in brutal displays of violence and a willingness to engage in open warfare. Ceremonies are a crucial aspect of Egregoros culture. They strengthen the bonds within the sect, fostering a sense of shared purpose and identity. Despite their ferocious reputation, the Egregoros operates under a code of loyalty. While they may seem anarchic and unrestrained, the group places great importance on mutual support and unity against common enemies. These are a few sample vampires within the Egregoros. To decide if you want to include this group in your setting, see the Deviance Truths.

### High-Priestess

Extreme. The High-priestess assumes the leadership of the Egregoros in Santa Maria, serving as the military, political, and spiritual head. She commands packs in warfare against the Olympus and presides over mystical ceremonies.

 Enhanced agility Pack hideout Quest starter: A violent Egregoros soldier has been killing mortals in your progenitor's territory. You must deal with her quickly. What are her reasons?

## Circle Of Circe

The Circle of Circe is a group of vampires renowned for its tightly-knit structure and commitment to the collective pursuit of occult knowledge and power. Central to the Circle's identity is their blood sorcery rituals, which allows them to manipulate the mystical forces inherent in vampire blood. The Circle of Circe is known for its rigid internal structure, resembling a pyramid with a council of powerful elders at the top. This hierarchical organization ensures a disciplined and orderly approach to their pursuits. Members are bound by an oath, fostering loyalty and a sense of duty to the group as a whole. While they value their internal discipline, they also recognize the importance of alliances and diplomatic relations within the broader vampire society. These are a few sample vampires within the Circle of Circe. To decide if you want to include this group in your setting, see the Blood Sorcery Truths.

### Headmaster

Formidable. The headmaster is the pinnacle of leadership within the Circle of Circe, bearing the deepest magical knowledge and the most calculating mind.

 Attentive eyes Drive Uncover the mysteries of magic Gain prestige within the circle

 Basic ritualistic knowledge Guidance from more experienced members Quest starter: An apprentice had her grimoire stolen. Where did she see it last time? Why do you agree to help her?

## Epitaph Order

The Epitaph Order integrates unlife with a devout commitment to a vampiric religion called Eudaimonia. This syncretic faith combines elements of religion from all over the world, and provides a shared moral framework for vampires. The order mirrors religious hierarchies, with sacraments reinforcing members' commitment. Vampires in the group see themselves as agents of divine will, enforcing moral codes and maintaining order within vampiric society. Despite a perception of conservatism, their dedication to moral guidance influences vampiric society within the Olympus, aligning with values of the Façade and political stability. These are a few sample vampires within the Epitaph Order. To decide if you want to include this group in your setting, see the Religion Truths.

### Hierophant

Formidable. The Hierophant wields both religious authority and social influence. Adorned in regal ecclesiastical attire, she leads the faithful into an unlife of penitence and devotion.

#### Drives

 Follow the word of the order Deepen my spiritual practice Features Enhanced willpower Quest starter: Members of the order suspect a group of lambs is following a secret cult of forbidden knowledge. What do you get in return of discovering who they are and what they aim?

## Crystal Compass

Mages of the Crystal Compass are humans who have gained access to magical powers. They wield these powers to manipulate reality, cast spells and tap into the cosmic forces that shape the world. The study of magical lore, ancient artifacts, and the personal pursuit of knowledge about magical truths are integral to a mage's journey. Mages often navigate political intrigue, mysterious cabals, and secret societies, all while attempting to unravel the deepest secrets of the universe in a meaningful way. They may come into conflict with other supernatural entities, not just vampires, as they pursue their magical goals. These are the average statistics for mages from the Crystal Compass. To decide if you want to include this group in your setting, see the Mortal Magic Truths.

### Sorcerers

Formidable. Fiercely independent, sorcerers reject authority and follow their own codes, ranging from strict discipline to a more reckless lifestyle. While perceived as corrupt, they can use their powers for both destructive and benevolent purposes. They recognize only themselves as masters, rejecting external codes of conduct.

 Powers of fate, influencing luck and fortune Powers of time and prescience Quest starter: A sibyl receives a vision: she requires a specific component for her ritual that's located somewhere in the city. While she can pinpoint the place, the nature of the component remains unknown. Additionally, she senses that the location is guarded by someone; however, she is unaware of their identity. She trusts that you will recognize the thing upon sight. What place is it? What do you encounter there?

### Necromancers

## Varou

The varou are lupine creatures with a deep connection to the forces of nature. They are warriors chosen by the spirits to safeguard the balance of the spiritual and physical realms. They belong to tribes, each with its unique culture and traditions. Vampires are their mortal enemy. Varou possess several forms, including the human, wolf, and combat form - an in-between state where they take the shape of large anthropomorphic wolves. The spiritual bond with totem animals and other spirits is a crucial aspect of varou culture. Rites performed by the varou are essential for maintaining spiritual harmony and drawing upon the power of the spirits. Their society is organized into tribes, groups of werewolves united by common goals and a shared totem spirit which guides them. These are the average statistics for varou. To decide if you want to include this group in your setting, see the Werewolves Truths.

Formidable. The dullclaw is a young and inexperienced varou, learning the ways of her tribe. Traits Energetic and curious demeanor.

Drives Prove myself worthy

## Lycanthropes

The Lycanthropes coexist in the city alongside vampires. To ensure their survival, they form small packs and carefully conceal their true nature from mortals. While they outwardly appear human, they possess the ability to transform into large bipedal wolves. Their relationship with vampires is complex. Despite not always seeing eye to eye, both species acknowledge a shared characteristic: they are supernatural beings with personal agendas, compelled to keep their existence hidden from human eyes. Lycanthrope packs often have distinct objectives and varying perspectives on their nature. In contrast to vampires, there is no central governing body; the packs operate inde-

 Human, combat, and wolf form Heightened senses Quest starter: A dullclaw who is linked to your progenitor by blood goes missing. What happened to her? Why does she have a blood link with your progenitor?

pendently and occasionally engage in conflicts with each other. The source of Lycanthropes' powers lies in their blood. Unlike vampires, they cannot create others of their kind; their existence arises purely by chance. When they transform, Lycanthropes sustain themselves by hunting large animals and occasionally humans, though they avoid killing people to prevent drawing unwanted attention. The core meaning of their existence is often found in the loyalty to their pack. These are the average statistics for Lycanthropes. To decide if you want to include this group in your setting, see the Werewolves Truths.

## Beast People

Beast people are cursed individuals with the ability to transform into large, monstrous animals. While werewolves are the most common, other variations such as werecats, werebats, werefoxes, wererats, and more also exist. This transformation occurs when a Beast Person deeply bites into the flesh of a human but allows them to survive. However, the drawback is that when a beast person assumes their bestial form, they lose control over their basic instincts, becoming violent and feral, while suffering absolute amnesia from this period when they go back to their human appearance. This internal struggle often results in conflicts within each individual, as they grapple with an inability to tame their vicious nature. For vampires, beast people pose a significant challenge. Due to their inability to act rationally during transformation, they tend to attract unwanted attention to the supernatural world. This frequently compels vampires to view them as a threat, leading to efforts to eliminate or control them. These are the average statistics for beast people when they are transformed.

To decide if you want to include this group in your setting, see the Werewolves Truths.

### Beast Person

## Mortal Threats

Driven by a range of motivations, these mortals are relentless in their pursuit, making the night a perilous time for vampires. Religious organizations view vampires as embodiments of evil on earth and have dedicated centuries to hunting them. Armed with ancient and occult knowledge, these organizations operate globally under the leadership of the church. Their hunters are marked by fervent faith, wielding sacred symbols, blades, and fire. Certain intelligence agencies, both private and governmental, are also cognizant of the existence of vampires. They deploy agents with specific missions to gather information on vampires and understand how to counter or exploit them. Their primary objective is not always to kill vampires. Not all hunters are affiliated with large organizations. Some operate independently or in small packs, often unaware of the intricate vampiric society. Guided by personal vendettas against the undead, they may lack awareness of the complexities within the vampire world. Despite their ignorance, these lone or smallgroup hunters pose a unique and unpredictable threat to vampires. These are a few sample average perilous mortals. To decide if you want to include this group of NPCs in your setting, see the What Mortals Know Truths. Also do so to decide if you want to include damage by holy symbols and such in it. To see the rules for this kind of damage, see Harm.

CHAPTER VI: 
GAMEPLAY 
IN DEPTH

## The First Session

### Character And World Creation

To start your Elegy campaign, explore your character's unlife, swear elegies, and navigate the challenges of Santa Maria, follow the steps in this section. Refer to Chapter II: Your Character for guidance on envisioning your character, setting stats, and choosing assets. If playing co-op or guided, discuss character connections with other players. You can shorthand ideas and flesh them out during play. Consider intertwining world and character creation, as setting choices may influence character options. For example, if magic is unknown, you might opt to ignore ritual assets. Establish your world by engaging in the Your Truths exercise. Review the options and make selections, paying attention to quest starters that may inspire background elegies or inciting incidents. Decide the starting point for your story by examining the districts of the city of Santa Maria. Collaborate with other players to envision the setting. Define basic facts for your world in a few moments, discovering the rest during play.

When choosing your truths, you establish the following about your universe: Santa Maria is a city that developed in the 1700s. Since then, vampires have lived in the city under a theocratic and totalitarian government
 *Vampirism is a genetic mutation.* 
Along with it, when a vampire creates another, she imparts one of her powers to the new vampire Superstitions are just superstitions, and humans do not have access to magic—neither do vampires Using the internet is allowed, and it's possible to have human allies
 *In your world, there are the* Egregors and the Lycanthropes When a vampire sings an elegy, she performs a blood handshake As character creation can start from anywhere, you seek inspiration in the section "Reasons for Embracement." The "Survival" option suddenly sparks an idea in your head: a mortal on the brink of death transformed to survive alongside her progenitor. This aligns with your truth about vampires being able to have human allies; your character could be a kind of liaison to the mortal world for her progenitor, who grew fond of her.

To generate more ideas, you glance over the list of assets or the downloadable cards available online. The "Veil" asset catches your eye: you imagine it would be cool to play a stealthy vampire, engaging in combat only as a last resort. You decide that this is the power you inherited from your progenitor. Considering she was the trusted human informant for her progenitor, you imagine she was a very intelligent, sensible, and cunning person. Because of this, you assign a score of 7 to her intellect and 6 to her glamour. At the same time, you imagine she could be someone brave and well-intentioned. Reflecting this, you give another score of 6 to her heart.

You realize it would be useful to have an asset that allows you to discern the intentions of others more easily. So, you choose the "Sixth Sense" asset. As you're not sure what to choose as the third asset, you decide to start the game with only two and decide on the third during gameplay. Similarly, you don't have all the information about your character's background, but it's developed enough to guide your actions and decisions. The gaps will be filled, and the mysteries revealed, during gameplay. To finally decide the name, you check the oracle. The dice give you the name Carol.

#### In Multiplayer

For collaborative world building in a co-op or guided campaign, work through the process with other players. Spend a few minutes outlining the basics, or dive deep for an extended session. Leave open questions and spaces to fill in during play. If you're the Game Master (GM), facilitate discussion, contribute to world building, and take cues from players to shape quests and adversaries.

### Background Connections

Write up to three connections for yourself (minimum of one). These connections can be with a group or an individual. Mark one progress in each connection's track according to its rank. In multiplayer, you can use these initial connections as your relationship to other player characters. If you're playing solo, establish connections with other characters through the unfolding narrative. If you prefer to dive straight into the action, you can postpone fleshing out the details of your background connections for later. "Save" these connections until you decide to incorporate them into your storyline. 

When you eventually introduce a background connection for a character or community, mark it. Then, contemplate how this bond was originally formed and consider its impact on your unfolding narrative. As at least one of your connections must be with your progenitor, you mark one for her (whom, according to the oracle, is named Joanne). For your second connection, you decide that Carol has a human contact who happens to be the best friend she knew in life. Just like with the assets, you choose to determine the third background connection during gameplay. Now, you need to assign a rank to each connection. To figure out what they are, you refer to the NPC samples. Since your best friend is an ordinary human, her rank is Troublesome. Meanwhile, your progenitor, an adult vampire with some influence, is considered Formidable. You mark 1 progress for each connection you have. This means 1 box for your progenitor and 3 for your best friend. As you begin the game with a level 1 blood link with your progenitor, you make a note of it.

### Background Elegies

When creating your character, create a background elegy that encapsulates a core motivation or ultimate objective. This elegy is a pivotal aspect of your character's history, whether sung decades ago or arising in response to recent events. Write this elegy and designate it with a rank of extreme or epic. Fulfilling this promise won't come easily. In the chronology of your story, it might demand months, years, or even decades to witness the elegy's realization or abandonment. It's entirely plausible that your background elegy may not experience significant progress in your narrative, but instead contributes to roleplaying nuances for your character and enriches your worldbuilding. Since the early years of your afterlife, you have aspired to hold a position of greater influence in society. You decide to label your background elegy as "become the new captain." Assigning it an extreme rank, you acknowledge that this endeavor will take time to materialize, and there is even a possibility that it may not come to fruition - yet, that doesn't matter. As a player, you believe that this ambitious goal will place your character in very interesting situations.

### Inciting Incident

The inciting incident is the catalyst that thrusts the protagonist into action at the outset of a story. Everything leading up to this point constitutes the backstory - the familiar world your character has grown accustomed to. In Elegy, the inciting incident represents the tipping point that compels you to embark on a life filled with danger, intrigue, and darkness.

To commence your character's narrative, visualize an imminent threat or a compelling need. You can select a quest starter from chapters IV and V, discuss it collaboratively at the gaming table, or ask the oracle. This shapes the trajectory of your initial session and initiates your character's journey. How to write a compelling inciting incident?

 Connect the issue to your character's background and motivations Ensure it's unsolvable on its own Add a ticking clock: urgency is paramount Make it a shared elegy in group play or a threat affecting loved ones in solo.

 Introduce complications amplifying the urgency.

 Act immediately, classifying it as troublesome, dangerous, or formidable. Resolve within a session or two to prevent escalation.

These guidelines can be applicable to any elegy, but are particularly pertinent to an inciting incident. Even if the details are not fully formed, imagine how the problem can contribute to a compelling narrative filled with drama, conflict, and unexpected twists.

Seeking inspiration, you flip through the NPCs chapter. In the Egregores section (included in your world thanks to your Truths), you come across the following quest starter under the Soldier: "Quest starter: A violent Egregoros soldier has been killing mortals in your progenitor's territory. You must deal with her quickly. What are her reasons?" As Carol values diplomacy, stealth, and cunning more than direct combat and violence, navigating this quest would be interesting. Facing challenges is what makes characters compelling, so you decide that this will be your inciting incident.

### The First Scene

When you're diving into the adventure, you've got two ways to kick things off: the **normal world** or in **media res**.

#### The Normal World

Start with a prologue that's all about your character - showing who you are and how you navigate the world. 

If you've got allies, use this time to act out your relationships and introduce everyone's backgrounds. Your inciting incident becomes the event or threat you face in your first session. If you're stuck on where to begin, use this to jump into the action. Ask questions about the characters, the world, and what's going on right now. Draw some conclusions or check the oracle. Look for spots in the story to kick off a quest.

You decide to spend some time developing your characters and your version of Santa Maria before delving into a more dramatic situation. You begin with an ordinary night in Carol's life, meeting her best friend in person and going out to feed. You establish that she sleeps in an abandoned building, considering the possibility of gaining access to a lair (perhaps someday you'll acquire it as an Asset). You roleplay the scenes, occasionally rolling the dice when the situation demands it, such as during the feeding process. In the midst of the night, Carol receives a direct message from her progenitor: "Meet me. Now." You recognize this as a sign of trouble and promptly head to the rendezvous point to assist your progenitor, ever ready.

#### 119 In Media Res

Latin for "in the middle of things," start your story at a crucial point. The inciting incident is happening right now or is a challenge you're fully aware of and need to deal with. You can kick things off with a high-energy, action-packed scene as you face the problem head-on. Or set up a scene where you sing an elegy, then decide what comes next. You visualize the scene where your progenitor imparts instructions to you. You immediately meet her in her office and observe her indignant visage. You discern her sense of offense at the invasion and crimes committed by the Egregors soldier as she narrates the situation in more detail. A mortal has died on a beach that is her private feeding territory, in a manner indicative of the Egregors' modus operandi, but attributed to a single individual. The police are still investigating the crime scene, so you must act more swiftly than they do.

### Sing An Elegy

To kick off your quest, respond to the inciting incident by singing an elegy. But first, immerse yourself in the story. Picture the scene. Describe your words and the act (see Elegies Truths). This marks a crucial moment for your character. For an inciting incident, designate your new elegy as troublesome, dangerous, or formidable. If you're sharing this quest, each player writes the elegy, and progress is tracked collectively. Ever loyal to your progenitor, you swear to find and apprehend the culprit. You bite your hand as she bites hers, and you clasp hands. She smiles with her cadaverous eyes at you. You sing an elegy and write its name alongside a progress track on your sheet. You believe this is a relatively straightforward task, but with some risks. Looking at the Sample Progress Tracks, you give it a Dangerous rank.

### Quest Plan

Feel free to map out the primary narrative steps in your quest. Identify essential information to uncover, recognize potential allies for assistance, and pinpoint adversaries to face. Your outline is a guide, offering scene and challenge ideas, with each significant step serving as a chance to make progress (see Progress Tracks). However, treat it as a rough, unreliable plan. If you're the GM and have challenge and event ideas, note them down. Yet, avoid locking yourself into a rigid path. Whether you're a GM or player, stay receptive to surprises, new concepts, input from fellow players, and the twists of fate. Be ready to discard even the most loosely defined plan. In essence, play to discover what unfolds. You contemplate the necessary steps to complete your elegy. Clearly, identifying the culprit is a priority. The most practical approach would be to interrogate the people in the vicinity of the crime about the peculiar events. Perhaps the owners of local shops have witnessed something. Additionally, if the police have been notified of the case, they might possess useful information. Next, you need to prepare. Despite your strong desire to try to persuade your target with words, you are aware that Egregors are not as diplomatic as you. Therefore, you won't go empty-handed or alone; you need a weapon and at least one companion. After that, all you need to do is ensure that the culprit never sets foot in the area again, however you can.

STOP THE EGREGORS SOLDIER 1. Find out who the soldier is. 2. Acquire firepower. 3. Find someone to cover me. 4. Meet and stop the soldier. These are four steps, suitable for a dangerous quest (two checkboxes per milestone), but they can evolve, grow in number or even be replaced depending on where the story takes you.

### Campaign Setup Summary

1. Create your character (see Chapter II).

2. Create your world. Establish the basic truths of your own world (see Your Truths).

3. Write up to three connections to represent your relationship to friends, contacts, or other loyalties. You must write at least one connection, which will be with your progenitor. Mark progress for each.

4. Write your background elegy. 

Give it a rank of extreme or epic.

5. Envision your inciting incident. 

Decide between a prologue (the normal world), or a beginning in the midst of the problem (in media res). Envision the scene.

6. Sing an elegy. Give it a rank of troublesome, dangerous, or formidable.

7. Imagine your next moves or what unfolds next. If it helps, outline the key milestones in your adventure. However, be flexible and play to discover the unfolding story.

## Fiction And Mechanics

Elegy operates as a game, employing mechanics to navigate challenges and situations. Actions are done, dice are rolled, and your character's stats, tracks, and assets represent their abilities. The mechanical outcomes, like adjusting your momentum or health track, add layers to the challenge and enjoyment of the game.

The fiction, on the other hand, shapes your setting and character. It influences your character's background, personality, motivations, and the world around them. As you play, you take actions through your character's imagined perspective. The fiction is integral in determining what happens next. The dynamic blend of fiction and mechanics creates a rich roleplaying experience.

### Leading And Following With The Fiction

In Elegy, a balance of mechanics and fiction is ideal. The fiction sets the stage for your rolls. Begin by picturing the situation, considering what's happening, what you're attempting, and the obstacles you face. If the fiction prompts it, roll the dice and handle the mechanical outcome within the context of the story. Connect any adjustments to your status tracks back to the fiction, envisioning their impact. Translate the result back to the fiction - how does the situation change?

### Finding Your Balance

The emphasis on fiction varies by situation and pace of play. Entire scenes, especially interactions with characters, can be explored through fiction without engaging in moves. At other times, you might breeze through the fiction for expediency. Use moves to infuse inherent drama and uncertainty into character actions, always seeking opportunities to enrich your world through the fiction.

![122_image_0.png](122_image_0.png)

As a player, you feel the urge to explore the nightlife near the sea, so you decide that your progenitor's particular area is a small beach in the Waterfront District of Santa Maria. You ponder on what the sea means to your character. Did she enjoy the beach in life? And in death, has that changed? You envision a brief and simple scene where Carol recalls a memory from adolescence. She's on the beach with friends, in the summer, savoring the pleasures of youth. Nowadays, much of her memories have faded away, but this one, she feels, will endure forever. She hears a ring. The elevator door opens, and she walks through the hall, leaving her progenitor's building.

### Fictional Framing

Elegy doesn't heavily rely on situational mechanics. Instead, details are often abstracted and dependent on fictional framing. Fictional framing adds texture to your story, determines the things you can or can't do, guides outcomes, and influences the rank of your challenges. NPCs lack detailed mechanical attributes, but align with characteristics established through play. Elegy doesn't use detailed mechanics for the difficulty of challenges. Instead, the fictional framing represents the requirements to overcome challenges in your world. Context and fictional framing replace difficulty ratings. For instance, facing an elder vampire in combat isn't mechanically different from confronting a common thug. The elder's terrifying nature is conveyed through fiction. In Elegy, dice outcomes are contextualized by the fictional framing, giving depth and consequence to your character's actions in the narrative reality you've established.

You need to get to the Waterfront District, but walking doesn't make much sense. Within the fiction, it's reasonable to assume that your character has access to urban transportation and at least receives resources to cover it from their progenitor. If there's a need to ask for help, it's sensible to presume that your progenitor will assist. After all, the two have a cooperative relationship. Elegy's rules don't define mechanical details for things like transportation, money, or equipment. Instead, these things are woven into the narrative. Although they don't translate into numbers in your rolls, they add depth and texture to your world. You decide to call a taxi through an app. Since the internet is allowed in your world by its truths, this won't be a problem at all.

### Zooming In And Out

In the role of the storyteller, director, and editor of your tale, or when collaborating with others at the table, you wield the power to manage scenes within the vivid fictional space you've created. Even in time-sensitive scenarios like combats, you can manipulate the focus and flow of time. A single roll might be a decisive blow or represent a flurry of attacks leading to a pivotal moment. Combat isn't confined to discrete rounds; mix it up. This ebb and flow defines play. Time is fluid, influenced by moves but ultimately under your control. If it adds to your story, if it's captivating, focus on it. If not, abstract it.

The taxi arrives, and you enter. You visualize Carol looking through the window, noticing the swift passing of cars, signs, billboards, and people outside. However, finding an ordinary taxi ride uninteresting, you cut the scene to Carol arriving at her progenitor's beach. Curious about the scene's atmosphere, you consult the oracle for Ambience, which responds with, "Rusty bicycles lean against rusty chain-link fences." This paints an image of an old bike rack against a wall, with fishermen, likely their owners, chatting and enjoying beer at a nearby kiosk. As Carol explores, you envision additional elements: the beach railing, the sound of waves, the scent of saltwater, lights from open shops, restaurants, and kiosks, and a perimeter marked by a police line reading "do not cross."

To avoid drawing attention, you observe from a distance, assuming there are a few police officers (roughly 3 or 4, specifics don't matter) near the crime scene. You decide to use your Sixth Sense to identify the person with the information you need. Since this action is either dangerous, risky, challenging, or dramatic, it triggers an Action Roll (see The Action Rol). The stat considered for this roll is Intellect, as stated in the description of Sixth Sense. You have a score of 7 in this stat, giving you good chances to score a hit. You roll a 10 and a 1: a weak hit. That's +1 focus for you, along with one more benefit and one cost for the action.

When you activate a power but do not score a strong hit, you must spend at least 1 blood. So, that's your cost; you get hungrier. The benefit is achieving something dramatic: this means you gain another +1 focus. Additionally, the asset guarantees +1 and +1 focus on the next roll related to this insight. Your focus score (which starts at 2) is now 4, and so is your blood score (which starts at 5). As you used Sixth Sense, it allows you to pose two of the following questions to the oracle:
 Who's the most susceptible person in here?

 Who's most likely to harm me?

 *Who's most likely to give me what I* 
want?

You decide to ask only the third question, as the others won't be of help. You inquire, "Is it a police officer?" to the oracle, with a 50/50 chance. The response is "Yes." Returning from the mechanics to fiction, you zoom in, visualizing the scene. Carol walks until she's close to the mortals gathered around the police perimeter, almost touching the yellow tape. The horror of the scene silences everyone, occasional murmurs breaking the stillness. The police officers converse quietly. You close your eyes for a moment, opening them as the image of the police officer's face appears in your mind, as if you've always known her. You see the officer conversing with her colleagues. Does she seem to be the group's leader? The oracle confirms.

Simultaneously, for a brief moment, you feel a sudden thirst for blood. You remain composed, mindful that feeding time will eventually come. Deciding to strike up a conversation with the police officer under the pretext of being a friend of the victim, simulating poignant sorrow, requires two mechanical interventions in the fiction:
 An Action Roll to activate your human appearance.

 An Action Roll to deceive the police officer.

For both rolls, the stat used is Glamour. In the first roll, you roll a 2 and a 3. Compared to your Glamour value of 6, this is a strong hit. You effortlessly take on a human appearance. You gain +1 focus and decide the benefit of the roll is to achieve something dramatic, earning another +1 focus.

In the second roll, you roll a pair of 1s. This time, comparing the values to your Glamour score of 6 plus the +1 granted by your successful Sixth Sense roll (7 in total), it's not only a strong hit but also a match, signifying an exceptionally positive outcome! You pick the benefit of +1 focus and gain another +1 thanks to your previous insight with Sixth Sense. In summary, you gain +4 focus points, bringing your total to +8. Your focus meter is already almost full! Returning to the fiction, you visualize the scene. Your canines retract, and the blood in your body pumps, warming you to a temperature you're no longer accustomed to. Your eyes gleam, and your face flushes. In the next instant, you collapse into fake tears. "Oh my God, I can't believe it... it's not possible..." You sob, stutter, leaving sentences unfinished—an incredible performance. The police officer looks at you like a mother looks at a child who scraped their knee. "Ma'am, I'll ask you to step back," she says. You continue to cry.

"Ma'am, please." A tear rolls down her face. She steps over the tape and asks you to follow. You both sit on the beach railing, and the other officers seem unfazed. As a player, you're not currently interested in creating a long, realistic dialogue, so you imagine the scene from afar, in fragments, like a montage. Carol cries. The police officer consoles her. Carol invents lies that suggest she knew the victim without needing to use their name. Your performance moves the officer, convincing her to break her code of ethics. She reveals everything the police know so far: it was a cruel murder, motivated by unknown causes, committed about 3 hours ago. The primary suspect matches the description given by those close to the crime scene—a person in a red coat, shaved hair, and a white mask. With this information, you conclude that the best course of action is to inquire about someone with these characteristics among other vampires. Assuming there's a Neutral Ground in the Waterfront District, you decide to head there. As neither the journey nor the arrival seems narratively interesting, you cut the scene and advance in time. Now, you find yourself sitting at a bar, prepared to use your Sixth Sense to discover who there can assist you.

### Managing Your Quests

Promised quests drive Elegy adventures, starting with your background elegy and inciting incident elegy. Progress means overcoming obstacles and facing challenges, with success leading to milestones.

#### Reaching Milestones

Think of your quest as stones across water, each a significant step forward - a milestone. Some can be planned, while others emerge naturally from the fiction. A milestone should directly relate to your quest, representing a major turning point that demands effort and sacrifice.

#### Marking Progress

Use the progress track to measure success likelihood when fulfilling your elegy. Filled boxes enhance success chances and reflect fulfilled story potential. Higher-ranked elegies demand more focus, effort, and sacrifice. When reaching a milestone, mark progress based on the elegy's rank.

After advancing further in the story, embodying Carol in another scene, posing more questions to the oracle, and executing additional Action Rolls, you uncover precise information about the culprit. This marks the first significant step in your quest. Since completing it signifies a substantial advancement in your elegy, you mark progress. As the quest is considered dangerous, you record progress by filling in 2 boxes.

### New Quests

In the midst of your current quest, you'll come across situations that open the door to additional elegies. These new promises may relate to your existing quests or emerge from unrelated challenges.

#### Secondary Quests

While on a quest, you might encounter a significant challenge or promise deserving its own elegy—a secondary quest. Sing an elegy and assign a rank. Only when you fulfill this secondary elegy does it contribute to your main quest's progress, allowing you to reach a milestone and continue. 

#### 129 Unrelated Quests

If you lack an elegy, struggle with the next steps, or want to explore a new narrative, introduce a problem. Use quest starters or check the oracle for guidance.

#### Delayed Quests

Sometimes, a quest requires aid from an NPC, but they have their own demands. Sing an elegy to satisfy the NPC, allowing you to continue your current quest. This new elegy will be addressed later, but keep in mind, ignoring a sung elegy has dramatic consequences, impacting your narrative and reputation.

#### Intersecting Quests

If you're managing two related quests, occasionally, a milestone may allow progress on both elegies simultaneously. However, this should be a rare occurrence, with paths intersecting at key moments rather than every step contributing to both quests.

The vampire who gave you the rest of the information, as per the Traits oracle, is described as Bold. Considering the option to invite her to be your partner in diplomacy (and, in the worstcase scenario, in combat) when dealing with the threat from the Egregoros soldier, you roll the dice. Fortunately, you manage to persuade her to join you, but she requests something in return. The oracle indicates her goal is to "seek a truth," and the action and theme are "interfere" and "betrayal." The most fitting and intriguing interpretation you , as the player, arrive at is that she wants you to uncover whether a certain person she knows is secretly a spy for the Egregoros. Accepting the mission, you recognize there's no time to waste, but you must make the promise now. You both bite your hands and shake hands.

### Fulfilling Your Elegy

When you believe your quest is ending, make a Conclusion Roll as the mechanical progress and narrative converge. Adjust the pace using the progress track, focusing on key objectives and turning points. You don't have to fill the progress track entirely; a weak hit or miss can lead to interesting stories and new elegy opportunities. Successfully concluding an elegy in service to a person or community allows you to reroll any dice when forging a bond with them. A couple of in-game nights later, you complete all the steps of your mission. 

You are ready to inform your progenitor that everything is done. You vividly visualize the scene where you deliver the successful message to your progenitor. But is it really a success? Could some threat come back? Is there nothing else to be done? Only time will tell. You advance the nights in a montage. To conclude an elegy, you need to make a Conclusion Roll. The result will indicate whether the mission was a success or not. You roll the two dice and compare the result to the number of filled boxes on your progress track. You score a strong hit. That means everything was a success, and the threat of that soldier is eliminated. You gain 2 XP, marking 2 circles in your experience track on your character sheet.

### Advancing Your Character

Earn experience points when you successfully conclude your elegy or form a bond and spend them on assets. Justify your choices with the fiction, guiding your story toward desired abilities or letting assets flow naturally from your character's goals and encounters. Assets can even become the focus of a new elegy, offering tangible objectives or rewards. You envision Carol's supernatural abilities strengthening with practice. Acknowledging her growth, you decide to upgrade her Sixth Sense asset.

In the next scene, Carol awakens at sunset, feeling revitalized and empowered. Pride fills her, but the journey to prove herself and become captain still looms large.
