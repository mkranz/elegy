CHAPTER IV: 
YOUR WORLD

### Vampirism

Vampirism is a supernatural condition of unknown origin. Vampires are unliving humans created when a vampire drains a person of blood and then feeds the corpse a few drops of their own vampiric blood. The vampire who turns a mortal into another of her kind is called the progenitor; while the newborn vampire is called the *progeny*. The act of creating another vampire is called embracement.

### Blood

Blood is vampire's only nourishment. They don't have to (and actually can't) eat food or drink beverage. To feed, most vampires prey on humans, although there are those that drink the blood of animals. Vampires spend blood to awaken every sunset. They can also do it when they activate their special powers, appear human for some moments or heal their wounds. When blood is spent, vampires risk getting hungry. When they have no blood in their system, they go into an entranced rage until they feed again.

### Appearance

Although their bodies won't rot, vampires are indistinguishable from corpses. They can, however, assume a human appearance (blush, retract their fangs, warm their body) whenever they need, if they spend their blood. This aside, they're just as diverse as living people.

### Weaknesses

Vampires get extremely tired during the day. At this time, most of them sleep. Fire, sunlight and the claws and fangs of supernatural creatures may inflict fatal injuries. 

### The Kiss

The kiss is how vampires refer to the act of feeding directly from a mortal. Vampires do not need to kill to get blood. When a mortal is kissed, they go into an ecstatic trance, and in the end they have no recollection of the incident. A vampire closes the bite wounds on the victim's neck by simply licking them.

### Substances

When a mortal has substances in their blood (alcohol, poison, etc.), the vampire who drinks from them will suffer the substance's effects.

### The Façade

If mortals found out that vampires exist, they would hunt them all down. To survive, vampires must keep their existence a secret from mortals. The Façade is the set of laws that protects this secret. There's three main laws: 1. You must hide your vampiric nature from mortals 2. Creating other vampires is an act of great responsibility and should not be done without the permission of the queen 3. You must not drink the blood of other vampires Breaking these laws is not just a crime, but a taboo. Because of that, most vampiric societies and organizations enforce them.

### The Feudal City

Vampires organize they society almost in a feudalistic way, basing they hierarchy on the city and its ruler, the queen. The queen is the official ruler of a city. She has advisors and helpers, and divides the city in territories among several minor rulers who have effective rule over their jurisdiction. Each city is not only independent from one another, but also geographically isolated since long travels (specially during the day) can be deadly to vampires. The main governing body of the vampiric society is called Olympus.

### Progenitor And Progeny

Traditionally, the progenitor is expected to guide and mentor the new vampire, helping them acclimate to their new existence as a member of the vampire society and instructing them in the laws and customs of vampire society. Progenitors are often responsible for their progeny's actions, especially during the early years of the progeny's existence. If a progeny causes trouble, the progenitor may face consequences as well. The emotional dynamics between progenitor and progeny can vary widely. Some progenitor-progeny relationships are supportive and nurturing, while others can be strained or even antagonistic. Betrayals, rivalries, and conflicts within a vampiric family (a group of vampires created by the same progenitor) are common. Vampires turn to their progenitors for orientation, but also receive responsibilities and missions from them.

### Reasons For Embracement

An embracement usually (but not always) happens because of one of eight reasons: 
 **Survival:** The embracement happens as a means of survival for an individual who is near death or facing imminent danger.

 **Desire for Progeny:** The embracement happens to ensure a legacy. This can be driven by a desire for companionship or loyalty.

 **Political Maneuvering:** The embracement grants political influence to the progenitor. The newborn can be a valuable asset in vampire politics.

 **Philosophical Reasons:** The embracement happens based on philosophical beliefs. The progenitor seeks someone who aligns with her worldview.

 **Cruelty:** The embracement is a punishment for a mortal. The progenitor condemns the newborn into the vampiric condition for amusement or manipulation.

 **Blood Linking:** The desire for a blood link, a powerful and mystical connection of loyalty and obedience, can motivate an embracement.

 **Hunger:** Sometimes, an embracement is accidental and impulsive, driven by an immediate need for blood and lack of control.

 **Allure of the Embrace:**
Mortals may actively seek out the embracement, enticed by the allure of immortality, supernatural abilities, or the promise of a new existence. This can occur willingly or through manipulation by a potential progenitor.

### Blood Linking

When a vampire drinks from another, she develops a deep, artificial affection called *blood link* for the vampire whose blood was drunk. These feelings get stronger with each drink, and three draughts are enough to produce the deepest adoration. Mortals and other creatures are susceptible to the same effects. The vampire who drinks from another is called the *linked*. The one who is drunk is called the *provider*. Every vampire is linked to her progenitor. The linked constantly feels artificial love and loyalty, even if simultaneously hating the provider. Many progenitors create blood links with their children to control them, and many queens impose them on criminals. 

Breaking the blood link is difficult. It always lasts one year from the last drink before slowly wearing off. The death of the provider is the only escape from it. Vampires might deliberately share their blood with each other to revel in the addictive properties of the blood link, sometimes even doing it to become immune to other links. No matter how uncommon this is, it is frowned upon by most vampires, seen as a twisted and decadent practice. Blood links have three levels: 
 First Level: You wish to impress, be accepted by and be closer to your provider.

 Second Level: You deeply care about your provider and go out of your way to please or aid her.

 Third Level: You feel a deep emotional connection, loyalty, and dependency, becoming almost like a slave. You are completely immune to the blood link of others, breaking every lesser blood link you might have.

### Neutral Grounds

Neutral Grounds are places chosen by the queen to act as locations for vampire gatherings and social events. She queen also names a keeper for each one of them, who plays the role of manager and host. 

Because the gathering of so many vampires at the same place might risk the Façade, the security in a Neutral Ground is always rigorously enforced. Cities usually have at least one neutral ground per distric.

### Elegy

To sing an elegy means to promise to accomplish something in dedication to a person or ideal. It is a reverence to the grief born from the demise of every soul that leaves a vampire behind; a vow vampires make each other, or themselves, over their own mourning.

## Your Truths

Truths are the bricks you build your unique world with. For each category in this section, choose one of the options (or make your own) and make it true for your vampire world. Your choices set the background and tone of your stories, and may even inspire different elegies. If you think none of the sample truths in a category correspond to the way you envision your world, feel free to adapt them or even create your own.

### History

Vampires inhabit Santa Maria since its early development, which happened…

#### Q …In The Dark Ages.

Santa Maria was a crucial trading post situated at the crossroads of major medieval trade routes. It soon became a hub for commerce and cultural exchange, full of prosperity.

Quest starter: Rumors are circulating about an ancient artifact that once belonged to a powerful vampire in the Middle Ages, believed to be hidden somewhere in Santa Maria. Retrieving this artifact could earn you the respect of your elders. What is this artifact? What's its origin? Where is it said to be? What guards it?

#### Q …Somewhere Between The 16Th And The 19Th Century.

Fueled by the advancements of the Industrial Revolution, Santa Maria became known for its factories and innovations in manufacturing. The city was pivotal in shaping the era's economic landscape, drawing a growing population seeking employment.

Quest starter: Legend says a gun that belonged to an old ruler in Santa Maria is being kept in a museum. This gun was used to kill many vampires a few centuries ago, and it would make a great trophy. Who convinces you to steal it? 

#### Q …At The Beginning Of The 20Th Century.

Santa Maria embodied the dynamism of a new era. Positioned as a cultural melting pot, it became a hub for cultural movements, scientific breakthroughs, and the pursuit of new ideas.

Quest starter: It is said that a build]ing designed by a vampire architect at the turn of the century contains hidden chambers that hold some kind of treasure. What does this building serve as? Why do you agree to invade and investigate it?

### Origins

It is widely accepted that vampirism is…
Q
 **…a genetic mutation, and vampires are their own species.**
Ages ago, vampires already believed they were integral to the balance of the world's ecosystem, if not in a natural way, in a supernatural one.

Quest starter: A renowned biologist is conducting an experiment on vampire blood, threatening the Façade. How do you get involved in this situation? How do you plan to silence her?

#### Q …A Punishment For Humanity'S Original Sins.

The curse unfolded when the first murder occurred, and a higher power condemned the killer and her descendants, ensuring they would never again walk under the sun. This marked the origin of the first vampire.

Quest starter: A cryptic parchment telling the story of the first murder has been found. It's in a strange language, and it seems to reveal new details of the story. How will you translate it? What details are these?

#### Q …An Eternal Enigma.

Even the most enlightened vampires harbor conflicting opinions on this matter. Each individual's perspective significantly shapes their interpretation, and there is no definitive answer to this question.

Quest starter: Vampires form a cult around the idea that it's possible to turn back into mere humans, but mortal authorities suspect something is not right with them. Why do you step in this situation?

### Superstitions

Q
 **Most of what you heard about vampires is untrue.**
They are not deterred by crucifixes, garlic, or holy water, and they can enter private domains without invitation. Astake through the heart merely paralyzes them.

Quest starter: A suspicious mortal is guarding a place with garlic and crosses. While she is clearly superstitious, she seems to be holding something of importance within said place. What gives it away? How do you get yourself involved in discovering what it is? What is this place?

#### Q They Reflect The Real Deal.

They're not superstitions. Garlic, holy water, crucifixes, and other religious symbols are actually harmful to vampires. A stake to the heart will kill them, and they can't enter a home or private domain if they're not invited to. *This* alternative enables the Superstition optional damage rule in page 40.

Quest starter: Garlic gas was released in the ventilation system of your progenitor. Who is the culprit? Why does she want to harm your progenitor?

#### Q Religious Symbols Are Dangerous In The Hands Of Actually Faithful People.

Authentic Faith is a supernatural force rooted in sincere, unwavering belief in a higher power, be it a religious deity or a philosophical concept. Mortals with Authentic Faith who wield divine symbols are capable of warding off and even hurting supernatural creatures, particularly vampires. A stake to the heart will paralyze a vampire. This alternative enables the Authentic Faith optional damage rule in page 41.

Quest starter: A visiting bishop in Santa Maria plans to bless the water in a large fountain, transforming it into a potent weapon against your kind. How will you stop her, considering she always carry with herself a sacred symbol that can harm you? What symbol is this?

### Genealogy

Q
 **Depending on their progenitor, each vampire belongs to one of five** 
different lineages.

Every vampire is affiliated with one of several "families," each characterized by distinct traditions and manifestations of vampirism. Lineages are transmitted when one vampire creates another, with each lineage embodying a specific archetype of the vampire myth, bestowing unique powers and inclinations. Members of a lineage may not necessarily resemble or behave like each other. This alternative enables the Lineages optional rule in page 76.

Quest starter: A vampire serial killer is targeting victims of a specific lineage. Which one is it, and why? What compels you to step forward and go after her?

#### Q All Vampires Are Unique And Different From One Another.

Vampirism manifests in what seems like a random manner, and each vampire is a unique entity with its own set of features.

Quest starter: A newborn vampire went missing. You know she had a unique ability, which should help you track her. What ability is this? Why do you swear to find the newborn?

#### Q Vampires Inherit One Power From Their Progenitor.

While powers may develop in a more diverse fashion over time, all new vampires begin their undead existence inheriting one special ability from their progenitor. This ability is random.

Quest starter: Two newborn vampires don't know where they come from, but believe their share the same progenitor. What power do they share? Why do you agree to help? Who is the progenitor?

### What Mortals Know

Q
 While it's not exactly legal, it's not uncommon for vampires to have human allies of some sort.

Having connections with individuals possessing valuable skills or occupying influential positions is advantageous, whether one is undead or not. However, it's crucial to exercise caution. Before disclosing your true nature, ensure that these individuals have a significant stake in maintaining your secret, that revealing the truth about you won't be easily believed by others, and that they don't intend to harm you.

Quest starter: A friendly mortal contact begs you to find her child, who has been kidnapped. How will you track down the culprits? Where is she? Do you ask something in return?

#### Q Secret Organizations Know Vampires Exist, And Hunters Are A Threat.

While vampires may go unnoticed by the majority, certain secret societies possessing occult knowledge remain vigilant. Among them are black ops agencies dedicated to unveiling the vampiric nature, alongside centuries-old religious circles committed to eradicating every monstrous entity. Investigators, spies, vampire hunters, and paramilitary units pose a tangible threat to the vampire community. This alternative gives access to the Mortal Threats NPCs.

Quest starter: Vampires are being killed in a serial fashion that seems to be the work of a skilled vampire killer. What's her modus operandi? How do you intend to catch her? What's in it for you?

#### Q Basically No One Knows Vampires Exist.

Beside mannequins - the human blood bags some vampires have - the Façade requires absolute secrecy and is enforced in a very efficient way. Those who know too much are immediately silenced.

Quest starter: Someone took pictures of you while you were feeding. This could mean a devastating blow to the Façade and a sentence for you. How can you prevent them from causing this damage? Where can you find the photographer? Who is behind all this?

### The Internet

Q
 **Using the internet is prohibited by law.**
In today's world, no information is truly secure. A single slip, and the Façade will crumble.

Quest starter: A ghost hunting YouTube show crew just got actual vampire activity on camera. What did they capture? How will you protect the Façade from them?

#### Q Using The Internet Is Permitted.

As long as you keep your unnatural habits away from social media and use fake accounts, you may use the internet however you want.

Quest starter: A couple of young vampires share their unlives openly in social media. Why do you step in to stop them? What's the last Façade-breaking thing they tweeted?

#### Q Vampires Have Their Own Network, The Umbernet.

Even though regular internet use is prohibited, the umbernet links all major vampire cities in a secure web, resistant to mortal interference and private. While it doesn't encompass all the information available on the internet, its functionality is similar.

Quest starter: Sensitive documents of one of your acquaintances were leaked from the umbernet to the internet. How do you intend to investigate this case? What does she promise you in return for your aid in finding the culprit?

### Rebels

Q
 **Plenty of vampires don't agree totally with the queen, and sometimes** 
they form groups.

These groups can be united by any social or political idea. The bigger ones can even have some influence, but they are never powerful enough to actually challenge the queen.

Quest starter: A small group of vampires is accusing and exposing a corrupt, bloodthirsty captain they want to take down. Why is taking part in this situation important to you? Who do you support?

#### Q Those Who Don'T Agree With The Queen'S Rule Will Be Silenced Or Punished.

The queen's law is absolute. Any organized political divergence from the traditions that hold her in power is a threat that must be eliminated.

Quest starter: Your progenitor was accused of conspiring against the queen. Written evidence that connects her to a radical group was found, but she swears the letters are forged. Who is the culprit?

Q
 The Agorean Movement is an independent Faction that questions the queen's authority and governs part of Santa Maria.

They advocate for individual freedom and self-governance, and resist the constraints of the queen's law. While their ranks include diverse ideologies, from idealists to nihilists, the common thread among them is a desire to challenge authority, question ancient traditions, and create a more egalitarian and liberated existence for vampires. This alternative gives access to the Agorean Movement NPCs.

Quest starter: A Agorean militant believes her collective's leader is a spy from the Olympus. Why does she trust you to uncover her leader's true colors? What does this collective fight for?

### Blood Sorcery

Q
 **The powers of blood don't manifest themselves through silly rituals**
While some individuals may follow peculiar esoteric traditions, the concept of vampiric blood sorcery is nonexistent in our world. Rituals are not a part of our reality.

Quest starter: A vampire is conducting mystical ceremonies involving animal sacrifice. The disappearance of numerous animals are making mortal society suspicious. How do you make her stop? What is her favorite animal to sacrifice, and why?

Q
 Vampires who know blood sorcery rituals are rare, but often powerful and wise.

They keep out of sight, so their methods stay secret, but they sometimes take vampires as pupils when they are worthy.

Quest starter: Rumors say there's an elder in Santa Maria who could teach you rituals - if you manage to find and convince her. Why are you so eager to be her apprentice? Where will you start looking for her?

#### Q The Circle Of Circe Is A Large, Influential Group Of Vampire Mystics.

They are meticulous in their studies, developing complex rituals, and mastering the manipulation of supernatural forces. Their focus on the arcane arts gives them a reputation for being scholars and guardians of occult knowledge within the vampire society. *This alternative gives access to the Circle of Circe NPCs*.

Quest starter: A bag of werewolf blood has been located in the local medical clinic. This not only endangers the Façade, as it would make a potent concoction for rituals, according to the vampire that contacts you. Why are you trusted with this quest? What do you get in return?

### Religion

#### Q The Government Has Tones Of Faith.

The most important practices are held in a cult-like fashion, and the queen and other important figures act as priestesses in these situations. It's something purely ceremonial, but it reflects the idea that the queen and her peers are more than simple vampires.

Quest starter: An important ceremony that will happen soon requires half the blood of at least 3 mortals. Why does the queen trust you with to collect it?

#### Q The Epitaph Order Is A Large And Influential Religious Organization.

Quest starter: A local mortal preacher has been saying things that go against the Epitaph Order's ideals. What commandment do they inspire humans to break? Why do you agree to silence her?

#### Q Almost No Undead Believes In A Bigger Power.

A few make prayers and have group meetings, but they have no political influence.

Quest starter: A vampire who was devoutly religious in life now attends nightly ceremonies associated with her former faith, drawing the curiosity of mortals who sense something's wrong about her. What's giving away she's not like them? How do you prevent her nature from being discovered by others?

### Deviance

Q
 **Vampires rarely break the three moral laws buried within their nature.**
Everybody has heard of a vampire drinking the blood of another, turning mortals into vampires without thinking twice, or even revealing their nature despite the risk, but they're really abnormal cases.

Quest starter: You hear rumors of a group of vampires killing others to use their vampiric blood to conduct dark, esoteric rites. What's their story? What do they seek through these rites? Why do you swear to stop them?

Q

Quest starter: Rumors say the Egregoros are planning to turn a serial killer into a vampire in one of their macabre rituals. How will you stop their plans?

Q
 **Vampires who create blood links with others of their kind or even** 
mortals are common.

They usually do it to establish a relationship of dominance and influence over the other individual.

Quest starter: A nightclub owner is compelling her human employees to drink her blood, binding them as servants through blood linking. They exhibit extreme submissiveness towards her, but tensions arise as they begin to compete for their employer's favor. Why do you intervene in this situation?

### Werewolves

Q
 **They live in packs within the city and call themselves lycanthropes.**
Werewolves are another type of creature that hides in the night. Vampires and them are not necessarily enemies: sometimes, they cooperate to keep their existences in the shadows. *This alternative gives access to the Lycanthrope NPCs*.

Quest starter: A pack of lycanthropes has taken an interest in a particular place, disrupting the local vampire hierarchy. Why do you involve yourself in this territorial dispute?

#### Q Are A Subtype Of Mindless Solitary Monsters We Call Beast People.

Quest starter: A werecat is terrorizing an area of Santa Maria and bringing unwanted attention from mortals. How will you eliminate this threat?

#### Q Tribes Of Werewolves Habit The Wild. They Call Themselves Varou.

They're not that many or that powerful. When they're organized, they form small groups. *This alternative gives access to the Occultist Mortal NPC*.

Quest starter: Occultists are conducting rituals in a beach that belongs to an elder, attracting mortal attention. What do you get in return for stopping them? What do their bizarre rituals involve?

## Q Human Beings Have No Supernatural Power.

Nothing will happen if they try to cast a spell or perform a ritual.

Quest starter: A mortal who claims to be a vampire is being accused of practicing dark magic by their neighbor. Why do you swear to defuse this situation?

### Elegies

The precious promises vampires make one another…
Q
 **…are documents written on paper and marked with a drop of blood.**
It can be a letter paper, a notebook page or even a napkin. Regardless of the material, it is treated as a contract. After singing an elegy, a vampire sheds a drop of blood on it and hands it to the one to whom she has sworn - or puts it in a safe place if she made the promise to herself.

Quest starter: Your progenitor writes her elegies in a special paper collection she owns. However, this collection was unfortunately stolen. What will you do to the culprit? Why is this collection so important?

#### Q …Are Made Verbally And Contemplated In Meditation.

Elegies are crafted like any promise, whether written or spoken. The vampire who creates one dedicates a few minutes to half an hour in silence and solitude, concentrating on it and visualizing its fulfillment.

Quest starter: While you were meditating on an elegy, the vivid image of a vampire smiling at you suddenly appeared in your mind. What strong emotion did this make you feel? Why does her appearance evoke in you a desire to discover who she is? 

#### Q …Are Sealed By A Bloody Handshake.

After a vampire sings an elegy to another individual, each one bites her own palm. They then shake hands, allowing the blood of both to intermingle. When a vampire sings an elegy for herself, she bites both hands and holds them together.

Quest starter: According to your progenitor, the mummified hand of an ancient vampire is somewhere in Santa Maria.

## Lineages

This optional system is used when you include lineages in your truths (see Genealogy Truths). When you include lineages in your game, every vampire belongs to one of several "families" with particular traditions and manifestations of vampirism. Lineages are passed on when one vampire creates another. Each lineage reflects one archetype of the vampire myth, granting them different powers and inclinations. They don't act, or sometimes even look, like each other. Creating characters when you play using lineages has a few twists. The first thing you must do is select your lineage.

 Each one has access to four (and only four) power assets, and one of these powers must be chosen as one of your three starting assets.

 Besides, your lineage dictates which stats can be your highest. It gives you two options: set one to +7 and the other to +6.
