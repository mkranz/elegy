6 CHAPTER II: 
YOUR 
CHARACTER

## Name

You have a name. Perhaps vampire historians will treat it with high esteem someday.

## Stats

There are five stats. Each is given a value from 5 to 7. When you roll dice, you usually compare them to one stat - the situation will tell you which one, or give you a choice. To start, arrange these bonuses across your five stats in any order: 7, 6, 6, 5, 5.

 **Force:** Physical strength, endurance, and aggressiveness.

 **Dexterity:** Quickness, agility and coordination.

 **Glamour:** Charisma, influence and charm.

 **Intellect:** Expertise, knowledge and observation.

 **Heart:** Empathy and willpower.

## Assets

Assets represent your abilities, background, skills, traits, and resources. When you create your character, you pick three assets. Assets may grant three different types of advantages:
- A bonus to a stat on action rolls
- Special abilities and fictional opportunities
- Using one stat in place of another on a roll

### Acquiring Assets

As you form bonds and conclude quests, you gain experience. For a few experience points, you can purchase a new asset or buy a new ability on an asset you already own. Always consider the narrative justification when you add an asset to your character. What have you done to gain these abilities? How have your goals changed to support this new focus? Make your selection meaningful in the context of your story. Power assets are assets are vampiric abilities that are developed by vampires while they sleep. Nature assets can only be chosen during character creation. Ritual assets are sorcery rites that can only be learned from very powerful vampires.

Assets cost 3 xp to buy and 2 xp to upgrade. When you upgrade an existing asset, do it in whatever order you like; you can buy the third ability before the second one, for example. Just notice your setting affects which assets are available in your game (see Truths). For example, you cannot choose a *ritual* asset if your game doesn't feature vampiric magic.

### Narrative Requirements

Narrative circumstances may force you into situations where you can't leverage a key asset, making your adventure more challenging and dramatic. Before you act using an asset, take a moment to ensure you are properly positioned and equipped to use those abilities.

### Equipment

In Elegy, you won't worry too much about equipment. You are dressed and equipped appropriately to your vision for your character. Make note of any important possessions or items you start with. These are things that might impact the narrative, or provide texture to your character's background. They don't offer mechanical bonuses unless they are represented by an asset; for example, when you possess a blade and the Cutthroat asset.

3. You can make your blood attract dangerous predators. When you do it and pour a few drops somewhere, beasts will immediately follow the smell and try to devour the blood.

## Background Connections

As you build relationships and complete quests in the service of others, you create connections. Connections provide narrative texture to your world by fleshing out other characters and communities. They give you places to return to, and people to reconnect with, when you don't know what to do. They also provide mechanical benefits in rolls. When you establish a new relationship with a character in your world, you track progress in a progress track that represents the development of your relationship and thrust. You can start your first section with up to three connections, but you must start with at least one: your progenitor - the vampire who turned you into one. 

For each connection you start with, you mark 1 progress according to their rank (this will be later explained in Progress Tracks.

## Condition Meters

Your character sheet has three condition meters: health, spirit, and blood. Their values are reduced when you face hardship, and increased when you recover adequately (see Harm, Stress and Hunger). They start at +5.

 **Health** represents your physical condition and stamina.

 **Spirit** is your morale and mental state.

 **Blood** represents how much your hunger for blood is sated.

### Impacts

Impacts represent temporary and permanent disadvantages. Each marked impact reduces your max focus by 1. Impacts also reduce your focus reset. If you have one marked impact, your focus reset is +1 (instead of +2). If you have more than one marked impact, your focus reset is 0 (instead of +2). Characters begin with all impacts unchecked.

#### Misfortunes

Misfortunes are temporary. They last until your character has adequate opportunity, resources, and time to recover.

 **Wounded** may be marked when you are at 0 health and suffer harm. You are severely injured.

 **Shaken** is marked when you are at 0 spirit and suffer stress. You are despairing or distraught. 

 **Starving** is marked when you are at 0 blood and lose blood. You are in a violent, hungry state. You lose 1 point of glamour and 1 of intellect.

#### Lasting Effects

Lasting effects are permanent. They forever impact your character through the focus adjustment and - more importantly - the narrative impact.

 **Permanently harmed** may be marked when you are *Wounded*, at 0 health, and suffer harm. You have suffered a wound that you must reckon with, such as the loss of an eye or hand, or bear physical scars that are a constant reminder of a harrowing incident. When this impact is marked, you have 0 health and you suffer more harm, you die your last death.

 **Traumatized** may be marked when you are *Shaken*, at 0 spirit and suffers stress. Your experiences have left you emotionally or mentally scarred. When this impact is marked, you have 0 health and you suffer more stress, your mind is forever lost.

 **Sinner** may be marked when you are *Starving*, at 0 blood and spend blood. You get so frenzied, you commit something that angers your ruler. Envision what it is and what she asks of you in exchange for letting you live. When this impact is marked, you have 0 blood and you spend more blood, you lose complete touch with your human side and turn into a beast.
