CHAPTER V: 
NPCS

## Npcs

NPCs in your game are characters other than your own and those of fellow players. They can be people, beings, or creatures. You roleplay interactions and act to influence, aid, gain help, or act against them. This chapter provides sample NPCs organized by category, offering many starting points. Choose what suits your version of Santa Maria, considering your Truths. Customize as you wish, shaping your world according to your preferences.

### Components Of An Npc

In Elegy gameplay, your character's abilities and actions take center stage, and NPCs are portrayed through fiction rather than mechanics. They lack stats, assets, or tracks. Sample NPCs offer broad details guiding their power in combat and social influence. Envision their personality and motivations during interactions. If uncertain, consult the oracle for characteristics or actions. Then, act accordingly based on your vision.

### Rank

NPCs have a single mechanical attribute, their rank, which represents how long it takes to create a bond with them and how much harm they deal and take in combat. They are also able to cause harm to your Spirit (stress) equal to their rank when they frighten or demoralize you, for example.

Elevate the rank by one (up to a maximum of epic) for exceptionally powerful NPCs. Conversely, lower the rank by one (to a minimum of troublesome) for less formidable adversaries.

 **Traits** are the common personality and appearance associated with each NPC
 **Drives** are their typical objectives
 **Features** are the usual tools they will use to achieve them, including supernatural powers and combat skills. They also represent what resource or assistance the character may offer if, for example, you fulfill elegies for them or aid them in accomplishing their objectives.

It's important to note that while these characteristics encapsulate average stereotypes, they do not universally apply over every individual within the diverse Santa Maria. All NPCs include a quest starter, which can serve as inspiration for your elegies.

### Npc Packs

When facing a group of foes, streamline progress tracking by combining them into a single progress track called a pack. This simplifies the process and speeds up the scene. Increase the pack's rank to reflect their collective ability to deal and withstand harm. For a small pack (around 3 to 5), raise the rank by one; for a larger pack (approximately 6 to 10), increase it by two. Facing more than 10 troublesome or dangerous foes? Group them into smaller packs. Envision appropriate consequences when inflicting harm on the pack - wounding, incapacitating, or driving some foes back. Successfully ending the fight indicates defeating the last opponent or breaking their fighting spirit. Note that formidable, extreme, and epic foes must each have their own progress track and cannot be grouped into a pack.

### Joining Forces With Npcs

When your story involves collaborating with helper NPCs to surmount challenges, it's crucial to assess their impact on the narrative and your actions. Treat them as characters, not mere numbers, by asking the oracle about their responses, performance in challenges, or next actions. Transform them into dynamic entities by assigning personalities, quirks, and motivations. Let them weave into your story and quests, influencing outcomes for better or worse. However, maintain focus on your character and allies throughout the narrative.

### Creating Npcs

Craft NPCs that align with your vision of Santa Maria, enhancing your narrative and enriching your character's adventures. Use the provided sample NPCs as a starting point, or create entirely new characters. Since NPCs lack mechanical details, it's easy to bring them to life without extensive preparation. When engaging in combat with an NPC, assign them a rank, and optionally note their traits, drives, and features. Beyond that, their motivations, abilities, and actions are entirely shaped by your storytelling. 

NPCs can choose to ignore, aid, or oppose your character. For recurring NPCs, take note of what you learn about them over time, particularly if you share a bond with them. Here are some sample NPCs you may encounter in Santa Maria. They are categorized into groups, some of which may or may not exist in your universe (refer to Your Truths). These characters represent common or prominent figures with varying degrees of power and hierarchical influence. When including them in your narrative, you don't need to limit yourself to the sample characteristics: you can give a vampire as many supernatural abilities as you see fit, for example.

Below are the average ranks for various types of NPC.

 **Troublesome:** Newborn vampires and average humans. 3 progress/harm. Inflicts 1 harm.

 **Dangerous:** Young vampires, capable mortals. 2 progress per harm. Inflicts 2 harm.

 **Formidable:** Adult vampires, dangerous mortals and young werewolves. 1 progress per harm. Inflicts 2 harm.

 **Extreme:** Elder vampires and adult werewolves. 2 ticks per harm. Inflicts 3 harm.

 **Epic:** Ancient vampires and elder werewolves. 1 tick/harm. Inflicts 3 harm.

In what secluded location does she typically reside?

## Olympus

The Olympus stands as the governing body of the vampire society, emphasizing order, hierarchy, and the concealment of vampiric existence. As the self-proclaimed keepers of the Façade, the Olympus seeks to maintain the delicate balance between the undead and mortal worlds. Its strict feudal structure mirrors the social order of medieval times and emphasizes the importance of tradition and respect for authority. The Olympus operates with a veneer of civility and sophistication. Diplomacy, political maneuvering, and social etiquette are prized skills, and conflicts are often resolved through negotiation rather than open warfare. Ceremonies within the Olympus are frequently formal and steeped in tradition. The neutral grounds, where vampires can gather without fear of violence, exemplify its commitment to structured social interactions. These aspects reinforce the sense of unity and loyalty within the group. These are a few sample vampires that hold titles within the Olympus.

### Queen

Extreme. The queen is the prestigious ruling authority of the city within the Olympus. She is responsible for enforcing the Façade, resolving internal disputes and maintaining the traditions of Olympus. In your version of Santa Maria, she might also be a spiritual leader that symbolizes a higher power (see Religion Truths).

The queen's hand entrusts you with the mission of finding her. What happened to her?

## Agorean Movement

The Agorean Movement is a rebellious group that rejects the rigid structure of the Olympus. Seeking to reform the system from within, they challenge the status quo through activism and a commitment to diversity. The movement values individuality, and their members frequently forge their own paths, resisting the constraints of traditional vampiric society. The Agorean mode of operation focuses on activism, political maneuvering, and community building. They use their collective strength to challenge oppressive structures and promote the idea that all vampires should have a say in the governance of their society. Instead of elaborate ceremonies, Agorean members often engage in open forums and debates to discuss their vision for a more equitable vampiric society. Their emphasis is on open communication and collaboration to bring about change peacefully. These are a few sample vampires within the Agorean Movement. To decide if you want to include this group in your setting, see the Rebel Truths.

### Director

Formidable. The leader of the Agorean movement is, in practice, its "queen". A director lacks the strength and respect from the title, yet holds significant responsibilities. She is voted by the majority and is not necessarily the oldest or most powerful vampire of the group. Some directors are motivated by a genuine sense of civic duty to the movement, while others seek power within the sect, using their position to acquire favors and influence.

 Confident demeanor Drives Liberate vampires from the oppresive Olympus Keep authority Features Influence over mortal institutions Magnetic charisma Quest starter: Someone sent a mortal with poisoned blood to the director.

Traits Street-smart clothing Drives Educate younger Kindred about the oppressive nature of the Olympus Organize protests

 Firearm Enhanced strength Quest starter: You are accused of killing an Agorean member in their territory. How do you prove your innocence to the director?

## Egregoros

The Egregoros stands as a rebellious group that rejects the norms and conventions of the Olympus. Instead of concealing their supernatural nature, they embrace it unabashedly. This defiance contributes to their reputation as monstrous and chaotic beings. They also deny the feudal structure of the Olympus, advocating instead for a more anarchic and fluid system. While this leads to a seemingly chaotic organization, it reflects the Egregoros's commitment to personal freedom and resistance against oppressive hierarchies. The Egregoros's modus operandi is characterized by aggression and combat. They revel in their predatory instincts, embracing the savagery inherent in their vampiric nature. This often manifests in brutal displays of violence and a willingness to engage in open warfare. Ceremonies are a crucial aspect of Egregoros culture. They strengthen the bonds within the sect, fostering a sense of shared purpose and identity. Despite their ferocious reputation, the Egregoros operates under a code of loyalty. While they may seem anarchic and unrestrained, the group places great importance on mutual support and unity against common enemies. These are a few sample vampires within the Egregoros. To decide if you want to include this group in your setting, see the Deviance Truths.

### High-Priestess

Extreme. The High-priestess assumes the leadership of the Egregoros in Santa Maria, serving as the military, political, and spiritual head. She commands packs in warfare against the Olympus and presides over mystical ceremonies.

 Devotion to the pack and the Egregoros ideals Personal advancement within the Egregoros

 Enhanced agility Pack hideout Quest starter: A violent Egregoros soldier has been killing mortals in your progenitor's territory. You must deal with her quickly. What are her reasons?

## Circle Of Circe

The Circle of Circe is a group of vampires renowned for its tightly-knit structure and commitment to the collective pursuit of occult knowledge and power. Central to the Circle's identity is their blood sorcery rituals, which allows them to manipulate the mystical forces inherent in vampire blood. The Circle of Circe is known for its rigid internal structure, resembling a pyramid with a council of powerful elders at the top. This hierarchical organization ensures a disciplined and orderly approach to their pursuits. Members are bound by an oath, fostering loyalty and a sense of duty to the group as a whole. While they value their internal discipline, they also recognize the importance of alliances and diplomatic relations within the broader vampire society. These are a few sample vampires within the Circle of Circe. To decide if you want to include this group in your setting, see the Blood Sorcery Truths.

### Headmaster

 Attentive eyes Drive Uncover the mysteries of magic Gain prestige within the circle

 Basic ritualistic knowledge Guidance from more experienced members Quest starter: An apprentice had her grimoire stolen. Where did she see it last time? Why do you agree to help her?

## Epitaph Order

The Epitaph Order integrates unlife with a devout commitment to a vampiric religion called Eudaimonia. This syncretic faith combines elements of religion from all over the world, and provides a shared moral framework for vampires. The order mirrors religious hierarchies, with sacraments reinforcing members' commitment. Vampires in the group see themselves as agents of divine will, enforcing moral codes and maintaining order within vampiric society. Despite a perception of conservatism, their dedication to moral guidance influences vampiric society within the Olympus, aligning with values of the Façade and political stability. These are a few sample vampires within the Epitaph Order. To decide if you want to include this group in your setting, see the Religion Truths.

### Hierophant

Formidable. The Hierophant wields both religious authority and social influence. Adorned in regal ecclesiastical attire, she leads the faithful into an unlife of penitence and devotion.

#### Drives

 Follow the word of the order Deepen my spiritual practice Features Enhanced willpower Quest starter: Members of the order suspect a group of lambs is following a secret cult of forbidden knowledge. What do you get in return of discovering who they are and what they aim?

## Crystal Compass

Mages of the Crystal Compass are humans who have gained access to magical powers. They wield these powers to manipulate reality, cast spells and tap into the cosmic forces that shape the world. The study of magical lore, ancient artifacts, and the personal pursuit of knowledge about magical truths are integral to a mage's journey. Mages often navigate political intrigue, mysterious cabals, and secret societies, all while attempting to unravel the deepest secrets of the universe in a meaningful way. They may come into conflict with other supernatural entities, not just vampires, as they pursue their magical goals. These are the average statistics for mages from the Crystal Compass. To decide if you want to include this group in your setting, see the Mortal Magic Truths.

### Sorcerers

Formidable. Fiercely independent, sorcerers reject authority and follow their own codes, ranging from strict discipline to a more reckless lifestyle. While perceived as corrupt, they can use their powers for both destructive and benevolent purposes. They recognize only themselves as masters, rejecting external codes of conduct.

 Powers of fate, influencing luck and fortune Powers of time and prescience Quest starter: A sibyl receives a vision: she requires a specific component for her ritual that's located somewhere in the city. While she can pinpoint the place, the nature of the component remains unknown. Additionally, she senses that the location is guarded by someone; however, she is unaware of their identity. She trusts that you will recognize the thing upon sight. What place is it? What do you encounter there?

### Necromancers

## Varou

The varou are lupine creatures with a deep connection to the forces of nature. They are warriors chosen by the spirits to safeguard the balance of the spiritual and physical realms. They belong to tribes, each with its unique culture and traditions. Vampires are their mortal enemy. Varou possess several forms, including the human, wolf, and combat form - an in-between state where they take the shape of large anthropomorphic wolves. The spiritual bond with totem animals and other spirits is a crucial aspect of varou culture. Rites performed by the varou are essential for maintaining spiritual harmony and drawing upon the power of the spirits. Their society is organized into tribes, groups of werewolves united by common goals and a shared totem spirit which guides them. These are the average statistics for varou. To decide if you want to include this group in your setting, see the Werewolves Truths.

Drives Prove myself worthy

## Lycanthropes

The Lycanthropes coexist in the city alongside vampires. To ensure their survival, they form small packs and carefully conceal their true nature from mortals. While they outwardly appear human, they possess the ability to transform into large bipedal wolves. Their relationship with vampires is complex. Despite not always seeing eye to eye, both species acknowledge a shared characteristic: they are supernatural beings with personal agendas, compelled to keep their existence hidden from human eyes. Lycanthrope packs often have distinct objectives and varying perspectives on their nature. In contrast to vampires, there is no central governing body; the packs operate inde-

 Human, combat, and wolf form Heightened senses Quest starter: A dullclaw who is linked to your progenitor by blood goes missing. What happened to her? Why does she have a blood link with your progenitor?

pendently and occasionally engage in conflicts with each other. The source of Lycanthropes' powers lies in their blood. Unlike vampires, they cannot create others of their kind; their existence arises purely by chance. When they transform, Lycanthropes sustain themselves by hunting large animals and occasionally humans, though they avoid killing people to prevent drawing unwanted attention. The core meaning of their existence is often found in the loyalty to their pack. These are the average statistics for Lycanthropes. To decide if you want to include this group in your setting, see the Werewolves Truths.

## Beast People

Beast people are cursed individuals with the ability to transform into large, monstrous animals. While werewolves are the most common, other variations such as werecats, werebats, werefoxes, wererats, and more also exist. This transformation occurs when a Beast Person deeply bites into the flesh of a human but allows them to survive. However, the drawback is that when a beast person assumes their bestial form, they lose control over their basic instincts, becoming violent and feral, while suffering absolute amnesia from this period when they go back to their human appearance. This internal struggle often results in conflicts within each individual, as they grapple with an inability to tame their vicious nature. For vampires, beast people pose a significant challenge. Due to their inability to act rationally during transformation, they tend to attract unwanted attention to the supernatural world. This frequently compels vampires to view them as a threat, leading to efforts to eliminate or control them. These are the average statistics for beast people when they are transformed.

To decide if you want to include this group in your setting, see the Werewolves Truths.

## Mortal Threats

Driven by a range of motivations, these mortals are relentless in their pursuit, making the night a perilous time for vampires. Religious organizations view vampires as embodiments of evil on earth and have dedicated centuries to hunting them. Armed with ancient and occult knowledge, these organizations operate globally under the leadership of the church. Their hunters are marked by fervent faith, wielding sacred symbols, blades, and fire. Certain intelligence agencies, both private and governmental, are also cognizant of the existence of vampires. They deploy agents with specific missions to gather information on vampires and understand how to counter or exploit them. Their primary objective is not always to kill vampires. Not all hunters are affiliated with large organizations. Some operate independently or in small packs, often unaware of the intricate vampiric society. Guided by personal vendettas against the undead, they may lack awareness of the complexities within the vampire world. Despite their ignorance, these lone or smallgroup hunters pose a unique and unpredictable threat to vampires. These are a few sample average perilous mortals. To decide if you want to include this group of NPCs in your setting, see the What Mortals Know Truths. Also do so to decide if you want to include damage by holy symbols and such in it. To see the rules for this kind of damage, see Harm.
