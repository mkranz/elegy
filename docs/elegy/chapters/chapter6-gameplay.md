CHAPTER VI: 
GAMEPLAY 
IN DEPTH

## The First Session

### Character And World Creation

To start your Elegy campaign, explore your character's unlife, swear elegies, and navigate the challenges of Santa Maria, follow the steps in this section. Refer to Chapter II: Your Character for guidance on envisioning your character, setting stats, and choosing assets. If playing co-op or guided, discuss character connections with other players. You can shorthand ideas and flesh them out during play. Consider intertwining world and character creation, as setting choices may influence character options. For example, if magic is unknown, you might opt to ignore ritual assets. Establish your world by engaging in the Your Truths exercise. Review the options and make selections, paying attention to quest starters that may inspire background elegies or inciting incidents. Decide the starting point for your story by examining the districts of the city of Santa Maria. Collaborate with other players to envision the setting. Define basic facts for your world in a few moments, discovering the rest during play.

When choosing your truths, you establish the following about your universe: Santa Maria is a city that developed in the 1700s. Since then, vampires have lived in the city under a theocratic and totalitarian government
 *Vampirism is a genetic mutation.* 
Along with it, when a vampire creates another, she imparts one of her powers to the new vampire Superstitions are just superstitions, and humans do not have access to magic—neither do vampires Using the internet is allowed, and it's possible to have human allies
 *In your world, there are the* Egregors and the Lycanthropes When a vampire sings an elegy, she performs a blood handshake As character creation can start from anywhere, you seek inspiration in the section "Reasons for Embracement." The "Survival" option suddenly sparks an idea in your head: a mortal on the brink of death transformed to survive alongside her progenitor. This aligns with your truth about vampires being able to have human allies; your character could be a kind of liaison to the mortal world for her progenitor, who grew fond of her.

To generate more ideas, you glance over the list of assets or the downloadable cards available online. The "Veil" asset catches your eye: you imagine it would be cool to play a stealthy vampire, engaging in combat only as a last resort. You decide that this is the power you inherited from your progenitor. Considering she was the trusted human informant for her progenitor, you imagine she was a very intelligent, sensible, and cunning person. Because of this, you assign a score of 7 to her intellect and 6 to her glamour. At the same time, you imagine she could be someone brave and well-intentioned. Reflecting this, you give another score of 6 to her heart.

You realize it would be useful to have an asset that allows you to discern the intentions of others more easily. So, you choose the "Sixth Sense" asset. As you're not sure what to choose as the third asset, you decide to start the game with only two and decide on the third during gameplay. Similarly, you don't have all the information about your character's background, but it's developed enough to guide your actions and decisions. The gaps will be filled, and the mysteries revealed, during gameplay. To finally decide the name, you check the oracle. The dice give you the name Carol.

#### In Multiplayer

For collaborative world building in a co-op or guided campaign, work through the process with other players. Spend a few minutes outlining the basics, or dive deep for an extended session. Leave open questions and spaces to fill in during play. If you're the Game Master (GM), facilitate discussion, contribute to world building, and take cues from players to shape quests and adversaries.

### Background Connections

Write up to three connections for yourself (minimum of one). These connections can be with a group or an individual. Mark one progress in each connection's track according to its rank. In multiplayer, you can use these initial connections as your relationship to other player characters. If you're playing solo, establish connections with other characters through the unfolding narrative. If you prefer to dive straight into the action, you can postpone fleshing out the details of your background connections for later. "Save" these connections until you decide to incorporate them into your storyline. 

When you eventually introduce a background connection for a character or community, mark it. Then, contemplate how this bond was originally formed and consider its impact on your unfolding narrative. As at least one of your connections must be with your progenitor, you mark one for her (whom, according to the oracle, is named Joanne). For your second connection, you decide that Carol has a human contact who happens to be the best friend she knew in life. Just like with the assets, you choose to determine the third background connection during gameplay. Now, you need to assign a rank to each connection. To figure out what they are, you refer to the NPC samples. Since your best friend is an ordinary human, her rank is Troublesome. Meanwhile, your progenitor, an adult vampire with some influence, is considered Formidable. You mark 1 progress for each connection you have. This means 1 box for your progenitor and 3 for your best friend. As you begin the game with a level 1 blood link with your progenitor, you make a note of it.

### Background Elegies

When creating your character, create a background elegy that encapsulates a core motivation or ultimate objective. This elegy is a pivotal aspect of your character's history, whether sung decades ago or arising in response to recent events. Write this elegy and designate it with a rank of extreme or epic. Fulfilling this promise won't come easily. In the chronology of your story, it might demand months, years, or even decades to witness the elegy's realization or abandonment. It's entirely plausible that your background elegy may not experience significant progress in your narrative, but instead contributes to roleplaying nuances for your character and enriches your worldbuilding. Since the early years of your afterlife, you have aspired to hold a position of greater influence in society. You decide to label your background elegy as "become the new captain." Assigning it an extreme rank, you acknowledge that this endeavor will take time to materialize, and there is even a possibility that it may not come to fruition - yet, that doesn't matter. As a player, you believe that this ambitious goal will place your character in very interesting situations.

### Inciting Incident

The inciting incident is the catalyst that thrusts the protagonist into action at the outset of a story. Everything leading up to this point constitutes the backstory - the familiar world your character has grown accustomed to. In Elegy, the inciting incident represents the tipping point that compels you to embark on a life filled with danger, intrigue, and darkness.

To commence your character's narrative, visualize an imminent threat or a compelling need. You can select a quest starter from chapters IV and V, discuss it collaboratively at the gaming table, or ask the oracle. This shapes the trajectory of your initial session and initiates your character's journey. How to write a compelling inciting incident?

 Connect the issue to your character's background and motivations Ensure it's unsolvable on its own Add a ticking clock: urgency is paramount Make it a shared elegy in group play or a threat affecting loved ones in solo.

 Introduce complications amplifying the urgency.

 Act immediately, classifying it as troublesome, dangerous, or formidable. Resolve within a session or two to prevent escalation.

These guidelines can be applicable to any elegy, but are particularly pertinent to an inciting incident. Even if the details are not fully formed, imagine how the problem can contribute to a compelling narrative filled with drama, conflict, and unexpected twists.

Seeking inspiration, you flip through the NPCs chapter. In the Egregores section (included in your world thanks to your Truths), you come across the following quest starter under the Soldier: "Quest starter: A violent Egregoros soldier has been killing mortals in your progenitor's territory. You must deal with her quickly. What are her reasons?" As Carol values diplomacy, stealth, and cunning more than direct combat and violence, navigating this quest would be interesting. Facing challenges is what makes characters compelling, so you decide that this will be your inciting incident.

### The First Scene

When you're diving into the adventure, you've got two ways to kick things off: the **normal world** or in **media res**.

#### The Normal World

Start with a prologue that's all about your character - showing who you are and how you navigate the world. 

If you've got allies, use this time to act out your relationships and introduce everyone's backgrounds. Your inciting incident becomes the event or threat you face in your first session. If you're stuck on where to begin, use this to jump into the action. Ask questions about the characters, the world, and what's going on right now. Draw some conclusions or check the oracle. Look for spots in the story to kick off a quest.

You decide to spend some time developing your characters and your version of Santa Maria before delving into a more dramatic situation. You begin with an ordinary night in Carol's life, meeting her best friend in person and going out to feed. You establish that she sleeps in an abandoned building, considering the possibility of gaining access to a lair (perhaps someday you'll acquire it as an Asset). You roleplay the scenes, occasionally rolling the dice when the situation demands it, such as during the feeding process. In the midst of the night, Carol receives a direct message from her progenitor: "Meet me. Now." You recognize this as a sign of trouble and promptly head to the rendezvous point to assist your progenitor, ever ready.

#### 119 In Media Res

Latin for "in the middle of things," start your story at a crucial point. The inciting incident is happening right now or is a challenge you're fully aware of and need to deal with. You can kick things off with a high-energy, action-packed scene as you face the problem head-on. Or set up a scene where you sing an elegy, then decide what comes next. You visualize the scene where your progenitor imparts instructions to you. You immediately meet her in her office and observe her indignant visage. You discern her sense of offense at the invasion and crimes committed by the Egregors soldier as she narrates the situation in more detail. A mortal has died on a beach that is her private feeding territory, in a manner indicative of the Egregors' modus operandi, but attributed to a single individual. The police are still investigating the crime scene, so you must act more swiftly than they do.

### Sing An Elegy

To kick off your quest, respond to the inciting incident by singing an elegy. But first, immerse yourself in the story. Picture the scene. Describe your words and the act (see Elegies Truths). This marks a crucial moment for your character. For an inciting incident, designate your new elegy as troublesome, dangerous, or formidable. If you're sharing this quest, each player writes the elegy, and progress is tracked collectively. Ever loyal to your progenitor, you swear to find and apprehend the culprit. You bite your hand as she bites hers, and you clasp hands. She smiles with her cadaverous eyes at you. You sing an elegy and write its name alongside a progress track on your sheet. You believe this is a relatively straightforward task, but with some risks. Looking at the Sample Progress Tracks, you give it a Dangerous rank.

### Quest Plan

Feel free to map out the primary narrative steps in your quest. Identify essential information to uncover, recognize potential allies for assistance, and pinpoint adversaries to face. Your outline is a guide, offering scene and challenge ideas, with each significant step serving as a chance to make progress (see Progress Tracks). However, treat it as a rough, unreliable plan. If you're the GM and have challenge and event ideas, note them down. Yet, avoid locking yourself into a rigid path. Whether you're a GM or player, stay receptive to surprises, new concepts, input from fellow players, and the twists of fate. Be ready to discard even the most loosely defined plan. In essence, play to discover what unfolds. You contemplate the necessary steps to complete your elegy. Clearly, identifying the culprit is a priority. The most practical approach would be to interrogate the people in the vicinity of the crime about the peculiar events. Perhaps the owners of local shops have witnessed something. Additionally, if the police have been notified of the case, they might possess useful information. Next, you need to prepare. Despite your strong desire to try to persuade your target with words, you are aware that Egregors are not as diplomatic as you. Therefore, you won't go empty-handed or alone; you need a weapon and at least one companion. After that, all you need to do is ensure that the culprit never sets foot in the area again, however you can.

STOP THE EGREGORS SOLDIER 1. Find out who the soldier is. 2. Acquire firepower. 3. Find someone to cover me. 4. Meet and stop the soldier. These are four steps, suitable for a dangerous quest (two checkboxes per milestone), but they can evolve, grow in number or even be replaced depending on where the story takes you.

### Campaign Setup Summary

1. Create your character (see Chapter II).

2. Create your world. Establish the basic truths of your own world (see Your Truths).

3. Write up to three connections to represent your relationship to friends, contacts, or other loyalties. You must write at least one connection, which will be with your progenitor. Mark progress for each.

4. Write your background elegy. 

Give it a rank of extreme or epic.

5. Envision your inciting incident. 

Decide between a prologue (the normal world), or a beginning in the midst of the problem (in media res). Envision the scene.

6. Sing an elegy. Give it a rank of troublesome, dangerous, or formidable.

7. Imagine your next moves or what unfolds next. If it helps, outline the key milestones in your adventure. However, be flexible and play to discover the unfolding story.

## Fiction And Mechanics

Elegy operates as a game, employing mechanics to navigate challenges and situations. Actions are done, dice are rolled, and your character's stats, tracks, and assets represent their abilities. The mechanical outcomes, like adjusting your momentum or health track, add layers to the challenge and enjoyment of the game.

The fiction, on the other hand, shapes your setting and character. It influences your character's background, personality, motivations, and the world around them. As you play, you take actions through your character's imagined perspective. The fiction is integral in determining what happens next. The dynamic blend of fiction and mechanics creates a rich roleplaying experience.

### Leading And Following With The Fiction

In Elegy, a balance of mechanics and fiction is ideal. The fiction sets the stage for your rolls. Begin by picturing the situation, considering what's happening, what you're attempting, and the obstacles you face. If the fiction prompts it, roll the dice and handle the mechanical outcome within the context of the story. Connect any adjustments to your status tracks back to the fiction, envisioning their impact. Translate the result back to the fiction - how does the situation change?

### Finding Your Balance

The emphasis on fiction varies by situation and pace of play. Entire scenes, especially interactions with characters, can be explored through fiction without engaging in moves. At other times, you might breeze through the fiction for expediency. Use moves to infuse inherent drama and uncertainty into character actions, always seeking opportunities to enrich your world through the fiction.

![122_image_0.png](122_image_0.png)

As a player, you feel the urge to explore the nightlife near the sea, so you decide that your progenitor's particular area is a small beach in the Waterfront District of Santa Maria. You ponder on what the sea means to your character. Did she enjoy the beach in life? And in death, has that changed? You envision a brief and simple scene where Carol recalls a memory from adolescence. She's on the beach with friends, in the summer, savoring the pleasures of youth. Nowadays, much of her memories have faded away, but this one, she feels, will endure forever. She hears a ring. The elevator door opens, and she walks through the hall, leaving her progenitor's building.

### Fictional Framing

Elegy doesn't heavily rely on situational mechanics. Instead, details are often abstracted and dependent on fictional framing. Fictional framing adds texture to your story, determines the things you can or can't do, guides outcomes, and influences the rank of your challenges. NPCs lack detailed mechanical attributes, but align with characteristics established through play. Elegy doesn't use detailed mechanics for the difficulty of challenges. Instead, the fictional framing represents the requirements to overcome challenges in your world. Context and fictional framing replace difficulty ratings. For instance, facing an elder vampire in combat isn't mechanically different from confronting a common thug. The elder's terrifying nature is conveyed through fiction. In Elegy, dice outcomes are contextualized by the fictional framing, giving depth and consequence to your character's actions in the narrative reality you've established.

You need to get to the Waterfront District, but walking doesn't make much sense. Within the fiction, it's reasonable to assume that your character has access to urban transportation and at least receives resources to cover it from their progenitor. If there's a need to ask for help, it's sensible to presume that your progenitor will assist. After all, the two have a cooperative relationship. Elegy's rules don't define mechanical details for things like transportation, money, or equipment. Instead, these things are woven into the narrative. Although they don't translate into numbers in your rolls, they add depth and texture to your world. You decide to call a taxi through an app. Since the internet is allowed in your world by its truths, this won't be a problem at all.

### Zooming In And Out

In the role of the storyteller, director, and editor of your tale, or when collaborating with others at the table, you wield the power to manage scenes within the vivid fictional space you've created. Even in time-sensitive scenarios like combats, you can manipulate the focus and flow of time. A single roll might be a decisive blow or represent a flurry of attacks leading to a pivotal moment. Combat isn't confined to discrete rounds; mix it up. This ebb and flow defines play. Time is fluid, influenced by moves but ultimately under your control. If it adds to your story, if it's captivating, focus on it. If not, abstract it.

The taxi arrives, and you enter. You visualize Carol looking through the window, noticing the swift passing of cars, signs, billboards, and people outside. However, finding an ordinary taxi ride uninteresting, you cut the scene to Carol arriving at her progenitor's beach. Curious about the scene's atmosphere, you consult the oracle for Ambience, which responds with, "Rusty bicycles lean against rusty chain-link fences." This paints an image of an old bike rack against a wall, with fishermen, likely their owners, chatting and enjoying beer at a nearby kiosk. As Carol explores, you envision additional elements: the beach railing, the sound of waves, the scent of saltwater, lights from open shops, restaurants, and kiosks, and a perimeter marked by a police line reading "do not cross."

To avoid drawing attention, you observe from a distance, assuming there are a few police officers (roughly 3 or 4, specifics don't matter) near the crime scene. You decide to use your Sixth Sense to identify the person with the information you need. Since this action is either dangerous, risky, challenging, or dramatic, it triggers an Action Roll (see The Action Rol). The stat considered for this roll is Intellect, as stated in the description of Sixth Sense. You have a score of 7 in this stat, giving you good chances to score a hit. You roll a 10 and a 1: a weak hit. That's +1 focus for you, along with one more benefit and one cost for the action.

When you activate a power but do not score a strong hit, you must spend at least 1 blood. So, that's your cost; you get hungrier. The benefit is achieving something dramatic: this means you gain another +1 focus. Additionally, the asset guarantees +1 and +1 focus on the next roll related to this insight. Your focus score (which starts at 2) is now 4, and so is your blood score (which starts at 5). As you used Sixth Sense, it allows you to pose two of the following questions to the oracle:
 Who's the most susceptible person in here?

 Who's most likely to harm me?

 *Who's most likely to give me what I* 
want?

You decide to ask only the third question, as the others won't be of help. You inquire, "Is it a police officer?" to the oracle, with a 50/50 chance. The response is "Yes." Returning from the mechanics to fiction, you zoom in, visualizing the scene. Carol walks until she's close to the mortals gathered around the police perimeter, almost touching the yellow tape. The horror of the scene silences everyone, occasional murmurs breaking the stillness. The police officers converse quietly. You close your eyes for a moment, opening them as the image of the police officer's face appears in your mind, as if you've always known her. You see the officer conversing with her colleagues. Does she seem to be the group's leader? The oracle confirms.

Simultaneously, for a brief moment, you feel a sudden thirst for blood. You remain composed, mindful that feeding time will eventually come. Deciding to strike up a conversation with the police officer under the pretext of being a friend of the victim, simulating poignant sorrow, requires two mechanical interventions in the fiction:
 An Action Roll to activate your human appearance.

 An Action Roll to deceive the police officer.

For both rolls, the stat used is Glamour. In the first roll, you roll a 2 and a 3. Compared to your Glamour value of 6, this is a strong hit. You effortlessly take on a human appearance. You gain +1 focus and decide the benefit of the roll is to achieve something dramatic, earning another +1 focus.

In the second roll, you roll a pair of 1s. This time, comparing the values to your Glamour score of 6 plus the +1 granted by your successful Sixth Sense roll (7 in total), it's not only a strong hit but also a match, signifying an exceptionally positive outcome! You pick the benefit of +1 focus and gain another +1 thanks to your previous insight with Sixth Sense. In summary, you gain +4 focus points, bringing your total to +8. Your focus meter is already almost full! Returning to the fiction, you visualize the scene. Your canines retract, and the blood in your body pumps, warming you to a temperature you're no longer accustomed to. Your eyes gleam, and your face flushes. In the next instant, you collapse into fake tears. "Oh my God, I can't believe it... it's not possible..." You sob, stutter, leaving sentences unfinished—an incredible performance. The police officer looks at you like a mother looks at a child who scraped their knee. "Ma'am, I'll ask you to step back," she says. You continue to cry.

"Ma'am, please." A tear rolls down her face. She steps over the tape and asks you to follow. You both sit on the beach railing, and the other officers seem unfazed. As a player, you're not currently interested in creating a long, realistic dialogue, so you imagine the scene from afar, in fragments, like a montage. Carol cries. The police officer consoles her. Carol invents lies that suggest she knew the victim without needing to use their name. Your performance moves the officer, convincing her to break her code of ethics. She reveals everything the police know so far: it was a cruel murder, motivated by unknown causes, committed about 3 hours ago. The primary suspect matches the description given by those close to the crime scene—a person in a red coat, shaved hair, and a white mask. With this information, you conclude that the best course of action is to inquire about someone with these characteristics among other vampires. Assuming there's a Neutral Ground in the Waterfront District, you decide to head there. As neither the journey nor the arrival seems narratively interesting, you cut the scene and advance in time. Now, you find yourself sitting at a bar, prepared to use your Sixth Sense to discover who there can assist you.

### Managing Your Quests

Promised quests drive Elegy adventures, starting with your background elegy and inciting incident elegy. Progress means overcoming obstacles and facing challenges, with success leading to milestones.

#### Reaching Milestones

Think of your quest as stones across water, each a significant step forward - a milestone. Some can be planned, while others emerge naturally from the fiction. A milestone should directly relate to your quest, representing a major turning point that demands effort and sacrifice.

#### Marking Progress

Use the progress track to measure success likelihood when fulfilling your elegy. Filled boxes enhance success chances and reflect fulfilled story potential. Higher-ranked elegies demand more focus, effort, and sacrifice. When reaching a milestone, mark progress based on the elegy's rank.

After advancing further in the story, embodying Carol in another scene, posing more questions to the oracle, and executing additional Action Rolls, you uncover precise information about the culprit. This marks the first significant step in your quest. Since completing it signifies a substantial advancement in your elegy, you mark progress. As the quest is considered dangerous, you record progress by filling in 2 boxes.

### New Quests

In the midst of your current quest, you'll come across situations that open the door to additional elegies. These new promises may relate to your existing quests or emerge from unrelated challenges.

#### Secondary Quests

While on a quest, you might encounter a significant challenge or promise deserving its own elegy—a secondary quest. Sing an elegy and assign a rank. Only when you fulfill this secondary elegy does it contribute to your main quest's progress, allowing you to reach a milestone and continue. 

#### 129 Unrelated Quests

If you lack an elegy, struggle with the next steps, or want to explore a new narrative, introduce a problem. Use quest starters or check the oracle for guidance.

#### Delayed Quests

Sometimes, a quest requires aid from an NPC, but they have their own demands. Sing an elegy to satisfy the NPC, allowing you to continue your current quest. This new elegy will be addressed later, but keep in mind, ignoring a sung elegy has dramatic consequences, impacting your narrative and reputation.

#### Intersecting Quests

If you're managing two related quests, occasionally, a milestone may allow progress on both elegies simultaneously. However, this should be a rare occurrence, with paths intersecting at key moments rather than every step contributing to both quests.

The vampire who gave you the rest of the information, as per the Traits oracle, is described as Bold. Considering the option to invite her to be your partner in diplomacy (and, in the worstcase scenario, in combat) when dealing with the threat from the Egregoros soldier, you roll the dice. Fortunately, you manage to persuade her to join you, but she requests something in return. The oracle indicates her goal is to "seek a truth," and the action and theme are "interfere" and "betrayal." The most fitting and intriguing interpretation you , as the player, arrive at is that she wants you to uncover whether a certain person she knows is secretly a spy for the Egregoros. Accepting the mission, you recognize there's no time to waste, but you must make the promise now. You both bite your hands and shake hands.

### Fulfilling Your Elegy

When you believe your quest is ending, make a Conclusion Roll as the mechanical progress and narrative converge. Adjust the pace using the progress track, focusing on key objectives and turning points. You don't have to fill the progress track entirely; a weak hit or miss can lead to interesting stories and new elegy opportunities. Successfully concluding an elegy in service to a person or community allows you to reroll any dice when forging a bond with them. A couple of in-game nights later, you complete all the steps of your mission. 

You are ready to inform your progenitor that everything is done. You vividly visualize the scene where you deliver the successful message to your progenitor. But is it really a success? Could some threat come back? Is there nothing else to be done? Only time will tell. You advance the nights in a montage. To conclude an elegy, you need to make a Conclusion Roll. The result will indicate whether the mission was a success or not. You roll the two dice and compare the result to the number of filled boxes on your progress track. You score a strong hit. That means everything was a success, and the threat of that soldier is eliminated. You gain 2 XP, marking 2 circles in your experience track on your character sheet.

### Advancing Your Character

Earn experience points when you successfully conclude your elegy or form a bond and spend them on assets. Justify your choices with the fiction, guiding your story toward desired abilities or letting assets flow naturally from your character's goals and encounters. Assets can even become the focus of a new elegy, offering tangible objectives or rewards. You envision Carol's supernatural abilities strengthening with practice. Acknowledging her growth, you decide to upgrade her Sixth Sense asset.

In the next scene, Carol awakens at sunset, feeling revitalized and empowered. Pride fills her, but the journey to prove herself and become captain still looms large.
