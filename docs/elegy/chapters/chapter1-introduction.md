CHAPTER I: 
INTRODUCTION

## Welcome

Elegy is a solo role playing game about being a vampire and surviving the big city nights while you hide your nature from mortals and prey on them to satiate your relentless hunger. You will hunt for blood to keep your vicious fury at bay, play your role in maintaining the secrecy of the vampire society, gamble what's left of your humanity and fight the deadly creatures that stand in your way. To play it, you create your vampire, make some decisions about the world you inhabit, and set the story in motion. When you encounter something dangerous or uncertain, your choices and the dice determine the outcome. Unlike other traditional role playing games, no GM is necessary. You portray a lone character in a dangerous world. A session can be as long as you like, from a few minutes to a few hours.

### What You'Ll Need

 Two ten-sided dice (d10). 

 A character sheet.

 Counters for marking status tracks on your character sheet (paper clips, beads, coins, etc.)

## Fiction & Rules

Elegy uses various mechanics, such as rolling dice and managing the stats and resources on your character sheet, but is also heavily reliant on the fiction, which is the imagined characters, situations, and places within your game. You will play from the perspective of your character and interpret actions and events in a way that is consistent with the dramatic, fictional reality you have forged for your story and your world.

## Elegies

An elegy is a type of song that expresses sorrow, lamentation, or mourning for the death of individuals, groups of people, or even abstract concepts. In vampire society, it can also mean a special demonstration of profound respect. To sing an elegy means to promise to accomplish something in dedication to a person or ideal. The act is a reverence to the eternal grief born from the certain demise of every soul that leaves a vampire behind; a vow vampires make each other, or themselves, over their own mourning. The biggest ordeal a vampire faces might be not the insatiable hunger, the deadly sunlight, or blending in among mortals, but the eternal grief she feels for her life, now lost forever. A whole world of relationships, plans, and dreams was killed, and its place seized by the obligation to the Façade and the nature of a monster. To vampires, death is truer than life, and grief is eternal, and that's why they swear on theirs.

## Your Vampire

### A Creature Of The Night

Most people live out their lives oblivious to the unnatural powers that surround them after dark, but you are different. You were turned into a vampire and thrown into a life of secrets, danger, shadows, and blood deep inside the heart of your city. Before you jump into the mechanics of your character, consider her motivations, interests, skills, personality, and weaknesses. It's fine to start with one or two ideas about your background and goals. You can flesh out your character as you play. 

### Your Sheet

You use your character sheet to track your stats, abilities, overall condition, and progress in your quests and bonds. However, your character is more than these mechanical bits. 

You are the protagonist in a rich story. You have hopes and fears, virtues and failings. Not only that, but you have a history. You are, or were, part of a community. This is the fiction of your character. Consider a few of these details as you create your character, but don't sweat it. You'll evolve it through play. At the start of your game, put your character on stage to see what happens. Fill in the blanks—for your character and your world—as you go.

### Be Awesome

Your character is highly competent. You're intelligent, apt, and driven. You can count on yourself to survive the night. When you sing an elegy, you mean it. You are not without your limitations. You'll face hardship. You'll make bad decisions. You will fail. Overcoming those failures, pushing on, is what makes you the cool predator you are.

### Be Who You Want

You can envision your character however you like, unbound by geography, lineage, sexual orientation, and gender. Your character can be inspired directly by a real-world or historical culture, or you might weave a blend of cultural influences into your concept.
