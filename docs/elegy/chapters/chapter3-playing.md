CHAPTER III: 
PLAYING 
THE GAME

## The Flow Of Play

Like most RPGs, you play from the perspective of your character. Your quests, and the characters and situations you encounter, will guide the fiction and the choices you make. When you have questions about what you find, how other characters in your world respond, or what happens next, you can go with what feels 

## The Action Roll

right. When you are seeking inspiration or want to put it in the hands of fate, you may ask the oracle. Use yes/no questions and the random prompts to generate interesting twists and new complications. Above all, if it's appealing, dramatic and fits the fiction, make it happen.

Whenever your character tries to do something dangerous, risky, challenging or dramatic, you have to make an Action Roll. Envision your approach and roll 2d10 (two ten-sided dice). Then, compare them to a stat (and other bonuses sometimes). The situation will tell you what stat to add. The total of your stat and any adds is your action score.

action score

There are three possible outcomes.

l l
 **Strong Hit:** Your action score beats (ties don't count) the value of both challenge dice. You succeed at what you are trying to do.

l f
 **Weak Hit:** Your action score beats only one of the challenge dice. You succeed, but with a cost or lesser effect.

f f
 **Miss:** Your action score doesn't beat either challenge die. You fail, or must make serious concessions.

### How To Make An Action Roll

If you act… With stealth, speed, or **coordination:** Roll +**dexterity**. With courage, willpower, or **empathy:** Roll +**heart**. With aggression, strength, or **toughness:** Roll +**force**. With charm, composure, or **manipulation:** Roll +**glamour**. With expertise, focus, or **observation:** Roll +**intellect**. And if you are aided by… **A useful related asset:** consider the bonus it gives you (if any)
 **Someone else:** add another +1 to your roll (or +2 if you share a bond).

Then, roll the dice.

l l You succeed. Gain 
+1 focus, envision the positive consequences of your action and choose a fitting benefit.

l f You succeed, but not without trouble. Gain +1 focus, select one fitting benefit and one fitting cost.

f f You fail. Envision the negative outcomes of your action and select one fitting cost.

#### Benefits

 **Your wounds are healed:** gain +2 health or clear Wounded impact.

 **You feed:** gain +2 blood (+4 if you kill your victim) or uncheck Starving.

 You're feel calmer and more motivated: gain +2 spirit or clear the Shaken impact.

 You create or seize an opportunity: you or an ally gain +2 in the next related Action Roll You achieve something cool or dramatic: gain another +1 focus You harm a foe, develop a connection or advance in an elegy: mark progress (see Progress Tracks).

#### Costs

 **You are harmed or tired:** lose health according to the situation (see Harm)
 **You are stressed, scared,** 
intimidated or despaired: lose spirit according to the situation (see Stress)
 You spend blood and get hungrier: lose 1 blood (see Hunger)
 You are put in disadvantage or in trouble: lose 1 focus

### Match

If the values on your challenge dice are the same, you've rolled a match. You can use a match as a prompt to add a twist, create a new complication, or introduce a new peril:
l l Introduce an interesting twist or new opportunity.

f f Introduce a tough negative outcome, complication, or danger. If you're not sure what a match means for the current situation, you can ask the oracle. If you're still stuck for an idea, move on.

### Focus

Your focus value goes from -6 to +10 and represents your inertia, luck, and confidence. Burning focus is a way to deliver a decisive result or avoid failure. When you have positive focus, after you make an Action Roll, you may replace your action score with your current focus value. After you burn focus, you must reset your focus by immediately adjusting your focus meter to your focus reset value. The default reset is +2. This value is reduced when you suffer an impact. If you have one impact marked, your focus reset is +1. If you have more than one impact marked, your focus reset is 0.

When you have negative focus, you must reroll any die that hits a score lower than your focus. For example, when you make a roll at -3 focus and score an 8 and an 1, you must reroll the 1. You only need to do this once - if you score an 1 again, count it as a hit.

### Using Powers

Vampires have two innate supernatural abilities: **healing their wounds** and **appearing human for one** scene. Besides these, a vampire has access to powers granted by the power assets she possesses. To use a supernatural ability or power, you make an Action Roll based on the asset's associated stat. When you score a weak hit or a miss, you are forced to spend 1 blood. When you score a miss, the power is activated, but you must select a second cost.

#### Healing

When you have a few moments to stay in place, you can focus your inner power to restore health. This situation triggers an Action Roll. On any success, you restore points of health or (one or the other) clear the Wounded impact.

#### Appearing Human

You can focus your inner power to give the appearance of life to your undead body for up to a whole scene. This way, you are able to trick other people into believing you are a mortal. When appearing human, you may talk to people without making them suspicious, have intimate relationships, drink and eat and digest food.

### Rituals

Depending on your worldbuilding decisions, you may or may not include Rituals in your setting. We'll explore this in depth in Chapter IV: Your World). Rituals involve step-by-step activities with gestures, words, and objects, activating special and more specific supernatural powers. Like regular powers from assets, they use your life force for their effects, but they need a more specific setup - one tailored to each ritual. During character creation, you can choose up to three non-power assets, including any ritual assets. Consider the impact on your character's story when making these choices. How did she learn this ritual? Where did she find out about it?

New rituals can only be learned when it makes sense in the story - like having a mentor or finding instructions in a book. This applies to both entirely new rituals and different versions of the same ritual within a specific asset. Most ritual assets represent a group of rituals rather than just one.In the narrative, the target of a ritual always feels something strange is going on. If she's a vampire, she'll know for sure one was cast upon her - even though she can't tell what it does. To use a supernatural ability or power, you make an Action Roll based on the intelligence stat. On a **strong hit**, the ritual is successful. On a **weak hit** it is too, but it consumes you: lose 1 point of blood, health or spirit (pick 1). On a **miss,** roll on the list below. 1-20. The ritual has the opposite effect 21-40. It attracts mortal attention 41-60. It affects a different target 61-80. It has no effect, and you waste or lose resource needed to perform it again 81-00. It has no effect, and it consumes you: lose 2 point of blood, health or spirit (pick 1).

### Tips For Action Rolls

#### Fiction First, Then Mechanics

What are you trying to do? How are you doing it? What complications might you face? Envision it. If, after thinking through the fiction, you decide you are doing something or encountering a situation that is risky, challenging, or dramatic, roll the dice. Depending on the scale of the current action, you might be visualizing a montage of flashes (a quick hunt to feed) or the passing of a mere second (an intense fight). Always think from the standpoint of the fiction, even if it's obvious you'll do. Then, translate the fiction into the mechanics of a roll, and back to the fiction again as you play out the result.

#### Not Every Action Must Be Rolled

Don't let a session jump from roll to roll without any roleplay, worldbuilding, or storytelling. If you're doing something safe and certain, you probably don't need to roll. If you'd rather gloss over something, do it. Rolls offer a potential benefit and cost, and it's ultimately your decision whether to risk the roll to gain the reward. 

#### Making Group Rolls

When you are adventuring with allies (other player characters), you will often act to resolve a challenge for the group. This represents your character taking the lead in a particular scene. You might serve as the spokesperson as you persuade someone, for example. Unless an action specifically offers benefits for your allies, any mechanical bonus you gain from a hit is applied only to the character making the action or Conclusion Roll. For example, if you represent your group as you conclude an elegy and score a strong hit, you take the mechanical reward. Everyone else benefits from the narrative success. Allies can contribute to your action by making an Action Roll to help you. On a hit, you gain a bonus you can leverage to improve your chance of success. If more than one ally does this, bonuses can be stacked. When you act for your group and face a negative outcome, you should apply mechanical and narrative costs as appropriate to the current situation.

#### Make Rolls Matter

Let your rolls flow organically out of the narrative. Don't make them purely for a mechanical benefit without some support in the fiction. Don't repeat a roll trying to get your desired outcome. A roll, hit or miss, should always result in a change to the current situation. For example, you are trying to persuade an influential vampire to agree to an alliance. You roleplay how you attempt to reason with her. Then, you make the roll, and fail. She refused. Why? What else do you learn, or what do they do to make your situation more complex or dangerous? Whatever happens, something happens. You shouldn't try to persuade her again unless you bring a new approach or leverage to bear. However, there will be times when you make a roll multiple times in 

## Progress Tracks

A progress track measures your headway against a goal or obstacle, including quests, connections, and fights. Progress is tracked in three different situations: **Combat:** When you face an enemy in combat, a progress track represents your advantage as you weaken or wound your foes in the fight.

 **Connection:** When you establish a new relationship with a character in your world, a progress track represents the development of your relationship and thrust. Give them a role: whenever your connection aids you on an action closely associated with their role, add +1 and take +1 focus on a hit.

 **Elegy:** When you Sing an Elegy, a progress track represents the sequence. For example, in combat, you'll often attack with consecutive rolls. That's fine as long as the rolls don't get too mechanical. Break up the flow of play with other actions, narrative beats, and events that cause you to rethink your approach. When in doubt, follow this guideline: If you've made the same roll three times in a row, switch things up.

challenges you overcome on your way to achieving your ultimate goal. 

When you create a progress track, give the challenge a rank. In increasing order of severity, the ranks are troublesome, dangerous, formidable, extreme, and epic. Progress tracks are drawn as a row of ten boxes, which you fill in—or mark—as you make headway toward a goal. When you initiate a challenge, these boxes are empty.

![36_image_0.png](36_image_0.png)

### Marking Progress

When you make significant progress, fill in the appropriate number of ticks or progress boxes per the rank of your challenge. **Combat:** Mark progress when you harm your foe.

 **Connection:** Mark progress when you: sing or conclude an elegy for them; give them something of worth; share a profound moment; leverage their help in desperate circumstances; stand with them against hardship; or overcome a test of your relationship.

 **Elegy:** Mark progress when you: 
overcome a critical obstacle; gain meaningful insight; acquire a crucial item or resource; earn vital support; or defeat a notable foe.

### The Conclusion Roll

When it feels like you've made enough progress to achieve the objective you're tracking, you may attempt to conclude it. This is a Conclusion Roll. Roll the dice and compare their value to the number of filled boxes in the track (ignore stats, focus, and bonuses). 

#### Strong Hit

 **Combat:** You've defeated your enemy, and their fate is in your hands.

 **Connection:** You now share a bond. Give it a title as a trophy, mark experience, and pick one:
 Give her a new role When she aids you, add +2 and gain +1 focus on a hit.

 **Elegy:** Your quest is complete. 

Give it a title as a trophy and mark experience.

#### Weak Hit

 **Combat:** You achieve your objective, but not for free. Envision an appropriate trouble, disadvantage, or loss that comes from the situation.

 **Connection:** You share a bond, but they request something from you. To mark experience for this bond, sing an elegy for them and fulfill it.

 **Elegy:** Your promise is fulfilled, but there's more to do. If you sing an elegy to set things right, take full xp. Otherwise, take -1 xp.

#### Miss

 **Combat:** You are defeated, or your objective is lost. Envision an appropriate, dire outcome.

 **Connection:** They reveal a motivation or background that puts you at odds. If you recommit to this relationship, clear half your progress boxes and raise the connection's rank by one.

 **Elegy:** The goal is lost to you. 

Envision an appropriate, dire outcome. This also happens if you abandon an elegy.

### Experience

When you conclude an elegy or create a bond, you gain experience ponts per the challenge's rank: Troublesome: 1 xp; Dangerous: 2 xp; Formidable: 3 xp; Extreme: 4 xp; Epic: 5 xp. You gain no experience by simply beating foes. You spend earned experience to gain assets or upgrade those you already own. When you upgrade an asset, you may choose the options in whatever order. In other words, you don't need the second point in an asset to get the third. Assets cost 3 xp to buy and 2 xp to upgrade.

#### Sample Progress Tracks Troublesome

 **Progress marked:** 3 boxes
 **Elegies:** Challenging quests with few obstacles
 **NPCs:** Newborn vampires and average humans
 **Experience awarded:** 1 point

#### Dangerous

 **Progress marked:** 2 boxes
 **Elegies:** Involving quests with lots of obstacles
 **NPCs:** Young vampires, capable mortals
 **Experience awarded:** 2 points Formidable
 **Progress marked:** 1 box **Elegies:** Complex quests with many intimidating obstacles
 **NPCs:** Adult vampires, dangerous mortals and young werewolves
 **Experience awarded:** 3 points

#### Extreme

 **Progress marked:** 2 ticks
 **Elegies:** Overwhelming quests of staggering proportions
 **NPCs:** Elder vampires and adult werewolves
 **Experience awarded:** 4 points

#### Epic

 **Progress marked:** 1 tick **Elegies:** Unlife-defining quests of unknowable scope
 **NPCs:** Ancient vampires and elder werewolves
 **Experience awarded:** 5 points

# Harm, Stress And Hunger

### Harm

Harm represents physical damage and injuries. How much harm you suffer depends on the situation. When you face physical injury or hardship, you reduce your health track by the amount of harm suffered according to the situation or the rank of your foe. In combat, you deal and suffer harm according to the rank of your foe. Each point of harm you inflict is marked as progress on your foe's progress track. **Troublesome:** suffers 3 boxes per harm, deals 1 harm
 **Dangerous:** 2 boxes per harm, deals 2 harm
 **Formidable:** 1 box per harm, deals 2 harm
 **Extreme:** two tick per harm, deals 3 harm
 **Epic:** one tick per harm, deals 3 harm When you successfully attack a foe, you inflict harm according to what kind of weapon you are using. **1x harm:** Improvised weapons, light impact
 **2x harm:** Sharp weapons, gunshot, heavy impact, fire For example, when you wield a knife (doubles your harm) and attack a Dangerous enemy (takes 2 progress boxes per harm), you inflict 4 progress boxes of harm on a hit. When you are at 0 health and suffer harm, you must mark the Wounded impact. If this impact is already marked, you must mark Permanently Harmed. If this other impact is already marked, you face your final death (see Impacts). To heal yourself, you must activate your supernatural powers (see Healing). You can also clear the Wounded impact by doing so, but you cannot do both in the same roll.

### Optional Rules

Depending on the decisions you make when building your world, (which we will delve into in Chapter IV: Your World) you may or may not include damage by holy water, garlic, etc. If you do so, consider the appropriate optional rule below.

#### Superstitions

When you opt to include superstitions in your universe, foes who use garlic, sacred symbols and holy water against you in combat are deadlier. When they deal damage, you suffer +1 harm. In other words, a troublesome foe who throws holy water at you deals damage as if it was dangerous.

#### Authentic Faith

Authentic Faith is a true and resilient belief in a higher power that you can choose to incorporate in your universe. If so, when a foe wield a symbol of a higher power they deeply believe in (a crucifix, for example), she is treated as she was one rank more powerful.

### Stress

Stress represents mental burdens and trauma. When you face hardships that test your psychological endurance, reduce your spirit track according to the situation. You also suffer stress when someone intimidates or frightens you.

 **1 stress:** An unsettling or frustrating incident.

 **2 stress:** A distressing or upsetting incident.

 **3 stress:** A horrifying or demoralizing incident.

 **4 stress:** A traumatic or heartrending incident.

 **5 stress:** A soul-shattering incident, loss of all hope.

When you're at 0 spirit and suffers stress, you must mark the Shaken impact. If this impact is already marked, you must mark Traumatized. If this other impact is already marked, you face desolation (see Impacts).

#### Respite

To recover spirit points or remove the Shaken impact (one or the other), you must make an action roll to socialize, share intimacy, or find a moment of peace.

### Hunger

Hunger represents how much a vampire feels the need to feed. They always spend 1 blood when scoring a weak hit or miss while trying to:
 Awake each sunset Appear human for a scene Use a supernatural power Heal wounds and restore health The hungrier a vampire is, the closer she is to losing her self-control and committing something that threatens the Façade.

When you have 0 blood and have to spend more, you must mark the Starving impact. If it is already marked, mark the Sinner one. If you already marked it, your mind is lost forever (see Impacts).

#### Feeding

To recover spirit blood or remove the Starving impact (one or the other), you must feed from mortals (or other sources, if you have adequate assets).

## Using Oracles

### Seeking Answers

You can ask the oracle to help guide your game session and trigger ideas when you need to know what happens next. Its most basic function is to answer a "yes or no" question. Combined with your own instincts and creativity, this (and other random prompts) can push your story in surprising and exciting directions. 

### Asking The Oracle

When you seek to resolve questions, discover details in the world, determine how other characters act, or trigger events, you may…
 **Draw a conclusion:** Decide the answer based on the most interesting and obvious result.

 **Ask a yes/no question:** Decide the odds of a 'yes', and roll on the table to the right to check the answer. 

 **Pick two:** Envision two options. 

Rate one as 'likely', and roll on the table to the right to see if it is true. If not, it is the other.

 **Spark an idea:** Brainstorm or use a random prompt.

#### Yes/No

| Odds are...    | Yes on...      |
|----------------|----------------|
| Almost certain | 11 or greater  |
| Likely         | 26 or greater  |
| 50/50          | 51 or greater  |
| Unlikely       | 76 or greater  |
| Small chance   | 91 or greater. |

On a match, an extreme result or twist has occurred.

### More Randomness

You'll find a set of random tables in the last chapter. These provide inspirational prompts and random results for common situations. You can also use whatever random generators you prefer, including those drawn from another game, online generators, or visual tools such as tarot cards.

### Trust Your Instincts

These random generators will never replace your own imagination and intuition. If it's interesting, dramatic, and pushes the story forward, make it happen. Too much reliance on random generators to answer questions about "what happens next" can kill the focus of your game or make it feel disconnected and incoherent. Keep it moving.

## Other Characters

The mechanics of Elegy almost entirely reference your character. Other non-player characters (NPCs) have a single stat (their rank) which represents how powerful or dangerous they are. Rank is taken into account when you fight or make a connection with NPCs. Further, NPCs do not roll dice to determine the outcome of their actions. If you have questions about an NPC's motivations or what they do next, ask the oracle.

### Connections

As you explore your world and complete quests, you create connections with people, which represent your current relationship. Connections give you advantages for relevant rolls when interacting with those you have connected with. Each connection is tracked in a progress track that's ranked according to the character's rank.

## Multiplayer

Elegy is primarily a solo game, but you can play it with more people if you want. There are two modes of multiplayer:
 **Guided:** One or more players take the role of their characters, the protagonists in your story, while a gamemaster (GM) moderates the session. The GM helps bring the world to life, portrays the characters you encounter, and makes decisions about the outcome of your actions.

 **Cooperative (Co-Op):** You and one or more friends play together to overcome challenges and complete quests. A GM is not required. The Elegy game system will help you explore the dramatic stories of your characters and their.

When multiple player characters share a same objective (a mission, for example), they also share the same progress track. You can see more insights on multiplaying Elegy in the Gameplay in Depth chapter.

# Optional Rule: Moves

Moves are, essentially, rolls adapted for specific narrative situations. You can use them, only if you wish, in place of Action or Conclusion Rolls when situations permit. For instance, if you're persuading someone, you can either make an Action Roll and adapt its benefits and costs to the scene or, if you prefer, opt for the *Compel* move. The difference lies in the fact that the Action Roll is a one-size-fits-all tool that can be performed in any context quickly; on the other hand, *Compel* offers a roll precisely designed for persuasion contexts, providing you with more ideas on how to navigate that specific situation. When you see a move name Italicized like this in another move's description, it means you have to make it. For example, every time you get a miss in a move, you'll be prompted to Pay the Price. That means that you'll have to make the *Pay the Price* move. Another difference in moves is that marking impacts or progress on a progress track is dependent on specific moves now. When you're prompted to mark progress, mark it on the track related to what you're trying to accomplish 
(see Progress Tracks).

### Adventure Moves

Face danger When you attempt something risky or react to an imminent threat, envision your action and roll. If you act…
 With **stealth, speed,** or coordination: Roll +**dexterity**.

 With **courage, willpower,** or empathy: Roll +**heart**.

 With **aggression, strength,** or toughness: Roll +**force**.

 With **charm, composure,** or manipulation: Roll +**glamour**.

 With **expertise, focus,** or observation: Roll +**intellect**.

On a **strong hit**, you are successful. Take +1 focus. On a **weak hit**, you succeed, but not without a cost. *Pay the Price*. On a miss, you fail, or a momentary success is undermined by a dire turn of events. Pay the Price.

#### Secure An Advantage

When you **assess a situation, make** preparations, or attempt to gain leverage, envision your action and roll. If you act…
 With **stealth, speed,** or coordination: Roll +**dexterity**.

 With **courage, willpower,** or empathy: Roll +**heart**.

 With **aggression, strength,** or toughness: Roll +force.

 With **charm, composure,** or manipulation: Roll +**glamour**.

 With **expertise, focus,** or observation: Roll +**intellect**.

On a hit, you succeed. On a strong hit, take both. On a **weak hit**, choose one.

 Take +2 focus Add +1 on your next roll (not a Conclusion Roll)
On a **miss**, you fail or your assumptions betray you. *Pay the Price*.

#### Gather Information

When you search for clues, conduct an investigation, analyze evidence, or do research, roll +**intellect**. On a **strong hit**, you discover something helpful and specific. The path you must follow or action you must take to make progress is made clear. Envision what you learn. Then, take +2 focus.

On a **weak hit**, the information provides new insight, but also complicates your quest. Envision what you discover. Then, take +1 focus. On a miss, your investigation unearths a dire threat or reveals an unwelcome truth that undermines your quest. *Pay the Price*.

#### Aid Your Ally

When you *Secure an Advantage* in direct support of an ally and score a hit, they (instead of you) can take the benefits of the move. If you are in combat and score a **strong hit**, you and your ally have initiative.

#### Compel

When you try to **persuade someone** 
or make them an offer, envision your approach. If you…
 Charm or lie: Roll +**glamour** Threaten or incite: Roll +**force**
 Pacify or encourage: Roll +**heart** On a **strong hit**, they'll do what you want or agree to your conditions. Take +1 focus. On a **weak hit**, as above, but their agreement comes with a demand or complication. Envision their counteroffer. On a **miss**, they refuse or make a demand that costs you greatly. Pay the Price.

#### 45 Use Power

When you **use your supernatural** abilities to activate a power, visualize the effects you want to manifest and roll the stat indicated in its asset card; if you use them to appear human for a scene (blushing, being able to have sex or consume food), 
roll +**Glamour**.

On a **strong hit**, the power is activated successfully. Take 1 focus. On a **weak hit**, the power is activated successfully, but you get hungrier. Spend 1 blood. On a **miss**, you get hungrier and the power is activated, but not without consequences. Spend 1 blood and Pay the Price.

#### Perform Ritual

To decide if you want to include rituals in your setting, see the Rituals Truths. When you perform a ritual of bood magic, envision what to want to achieve and how you perform it. Then, roll +**intellect**. On a **strong hit**, the ritual is performed successfully. Take 1 focus. On a **weak hit**, the ritual is performed successfully, but it consumes the blood within you. Spend 1 blood.

On a **miss**, the ritual consumes your blood and has undesired consequences. Spend 1 blood roll on the list below: 1-20. The ritual has the opposite effect 21-40. It attracts mortal attention 41-60. It affects a different target 61-80. It has no effect, and you waste or lose resource needed to perform it again 81-00. It has no effect, and it consumes you: lose 2 point of blood, health or spirit (pick 1).

#### Rest

When you spend the whole daytime in deep sleep in a dark place, roll +heart or +**intellect**, whichever is higher. By default, you need the Lair asset to have access to a secure place to sleep you can call yours. If you don't have it, you must sleep in abandoned places. On a **strong hit**, you rest well, and get both bonuses below: Restore 1 health Gain +2 focus On a **weak hit**, you have a regular day of sleep. Pick one of the bonuses above On a miss, pick one of the options below. On a match, pick both: You get hungrier: lose 1 blood You don't sleep well: lose 1 focus

#### Advance

When you focus on your skills, receive training, find inspiration or earn a reward, you may spend 3 xp to add a new asset, or 2 xp to upgrade one. The chosen asset must be framed within fiction and make sense in the context. For example, if you're by yourself without any access to blood sorcery knowledge, you can't learn or upgrade a ritual asset.

#### Heal

When you spend a few seconds in place and use your supernatural abilities to heal yourself, roll +force.

On a **strong hit**, the care is helpful. If you are wounded, clear the impact and take or give +2 health. Otherwise, take +3 health. Spend 1 blood. On a **weak hit**, as above, but the recovery costs extra time or resources. Choose one: lose 2 focus and spend 1 blood or spend 2 blood. On a miss, the aid is ineffective and the situation worsens. *Pay the Price*.

#### Respite

When you socialize, share intimacy, or find a moment of peace, roll 
+**heart**.

On a **strong hit**, you find companionship or comfort and your spirit is strengthened. If you are shaken, clear the impact and take +1 spirit. Otherwise, take +2 spirit. On a **weak hit**, as above, but this indulgence is fleeting. Envision an interruption, complication, or inner conflict. Then, lose focus (-1). On a **miss**, you take no comfort and the situation worsens. *Pay the Price*.

#### Feed

When you **attempt to drink blood** from a living being, envision the scene. If you act with…
 …brutality and physically overwhelm your struggling victim, roll +**force**.

 …speed or ambush an unsuspecting victim, roll +**dexterity**.

 …**charm or seduces** your victim, roll +**glamour**.

 …somehow manage to get your victim's consent, roll +**heart**.

On a **strong hit**, gain 1 focus and choose one:
 gain 2 blood and keep the victim alive gain 4 blood and kill the victim, but lose 3 spirit On a **weak hit**, do the same as above, but lose 1 focus instead of gaining it. On a miss, you are unable to feed due to an adversity. Pay the Price.

### Quest Moves

#### Sing An Elegy

When you **swear to complete a quest**, write your elegy and give it a rank. Then, roll +**heart**. If you make this promise to a connection, add +1; if you share a bond, add +2.

 On a **strong hit**, you are emboldened, and it is clear what you must do next. Take +2 focus.

 On a **weak hit**, you are determined but begin your quest with more questions than answers. Take +1 focus, and envision what you do to find a path forward.

 On a **miss**, you must overcome a significant obstacle before you begin your quest. Envision what stands in your way.

#### Reach A Milestone

When you make significant progress in your quest by overcoming a critical obstacle, solving a complex mystery, defeating a powerful threat, gaining vital support, or acquiring a crucial item, you may mark progress.

 Troublesome quest: Mark 3 boxes.

 Dangerous quest: Mark 2 boxes. Formidable quest: Mark 1boxes. Extreme quest: Mark 2 ticks. Epic quest: Mark 1 tick.

#### Fulfill Your Elegy

When you achieve what you believe to be the fulfillment of your promise, roll the challenge dice and compare to your progress. Focus is ignored on this roll. On a **strong hit**, your quest is complete. Mark experience (troublesome=1; dangerous=2; formidable=3; extreme=4; epic=5). On a **weak hit**, there is more to be done, or you realize the truth of your quest. Envision what you discover (ask the oracle if unsure). Then, mark experience (troublesome=0; dangerous=1; formidable=2; extreme=3; epic=4). You may Sing an Elegy to set things right. If you do, add +1. On a **miss**, your quest is undone. Envision what happens (ask the oracle if unsure), and choose one.

 You recommit: Clear all but one filled progress, and raise the quest's rank by one (if not already epic).

 You give up: Forsake Your Elegy

#### Forsake Your Elegy

When you renounce your quest, betray your promise, or the goal is lost to you, clear the elegy. Then, envision the impact of this failure and pick one or more as appropriate to the nature of the elegy. Any allies who shared this vow may also envision a cost.

 You are demoralized or dispirited: Lose spirit according to the situation (see Stress)
 A connection loses faith: Test Your Relationship when you next interact.

 Your supernatural abilities weaken drastically: Discard a power asset.

 You must abandon a path or resource: Discard an asset (not a power or nature one).
